<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Different types of scientific investigation yield different degrees of understanding that represent progressively greater ability to influence given phenomena. Description refers to a scientist collecting facts about entities or events, which can raise interesting questions and establish hypotheses for further study. Prediction is the outcome of more systematic observation when a scientist finds that two events often covary; when correlations are demonstrated in this manner, the probability of one event occurring can be more confidently predicted given the presence of the other event, although at this level the scientist cannot refer to the relationship between the two events as a causal one. When a scientist actually manipulates events, however, and shows that a change they make in one event (an "independent variable") repeatedly results in some change in a second event (a target or "dependent variable")-and when they have accounted for and reduced the likelihood that some other variable is responsible for that changewhen, in other words, they have demonstrated a functional relationship between these variables, they have achieved experimental control of the phenomena being studied. Behavior analysts consider control to be the most desirable level of understanding because functional relations are the potential basis for developing applied techniques for behavior change. In this respect, behavior analysis is characterized by pragmatism, the philosophical position that the "truth" of scientific findings is to be judged by the extent to which they lead to effective action.</p><p>The pursuit of scientific understanding of natural phenomena-including behavior-is characterized by an overriding set of assumptions and values: determinism, empiricism, experimentation, replication, parsimony, and philosophic doubt. Determinism-the notion that the universe is a lawful and orderly place in which all events occur as the result of other events-is the assumption upon which scientific endeavors are predicated. Indeed, if events were not determined in a reasonably orderly fashion-if phenomena randomly occurred simply as a matter of chance-then there would be no basis for viable technologies of behavior change. The development of useful behavior change techniques, in other words, rests on the belief that all behavior is the result of specifiable conditions and that these conditions, once identified, can be managed in a way that will influence the future probability of behavior. Other qualities that guide success in science include thoroughness, curiosity, perseverance, diligence, ethics, and honesty. John B. Watson-one of the first and best known individuals to identify as a "behaviorist" early in the 20 th century-departed from psychology's focus at the time on introspection and mental processes, and suggested that human behavior could be studied using the observational tactics of natural science. His behaviorism, which came to be known as S-R psychology-and also came to be known for fantastic claims-could not account for apparently "spontaneous" acts: for behavior, in other words, that lacked obvious antecedents. Numerous efforts to fill these explanatory gaps once again elevated mental states and constructs to causal status with respect to human behavior. B. F. Skinner, in contrast, remained focused on environmental events and eventually showed, through what he called the experimental analysis of behavior (EAB), that much behavior is changed and maintained by the consequences it produces. Thus Skinner identified operant behavior and elaborated Watson's formulation with a new paradigm called the three-term contingency (S-R-S), a model that remains the fundamental unit of study and focus of practice in the four domains of modern behavior analysis: behaviorism, the experimental analysis of behavior, applied behavior analysis (ABA), and behavior analytic practice. Skinner's conceptual formulation of behaviorism-the philosophical domain of behavior analysis-is known as radical behaviorism because it maintains that thoughts and feelings (what he called "private events" that occur "inside the skin") are simply less accessible forms of behavior that otherwise can be understood in the same terms and studied by the same means as overt behavior, without appealing to intervening hypothetical constructs. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>Behavior analysts study behaviorthe activity of living organisms. Although the study of behavior includes single responses, applied behavior analysts are interested in larger sets of socially significant behavior referred to as response classes; the sum of response classes an individual can perform at any given point in their development is their behavioral repertoire. A response class comprises a set of actions that may vary in topography (form) and that all have essentially the same effect on the environment. The environment refers to the physical setting and circumstances that comprise the context for a response; responses can only be studied and understood with respect to their environment.</p><p>When behavior analysts talk about stimuli they are not referring to all the static elements that constitute an environment but rather to stimulus events within a given setting that enter into an active relationship with some form of response. Stimulus events can be discussed in terms of their physical, temporal, and functional features (where function refers to their effect on members of a response class). A group of stimuli that share common features along some or all of these dimensions make up a stimulus class. Stimulus changes that occur in time before a response are called antecedent events (or just antecedents); those changes that temporally occur immediately following a response are called consequences. Antecedents and consequences may have one or two effects on behavior: (a) an immediate but temporary increase or decrease in the frequency of a type of response within the given setting, and/or (b) a delayed but relatively permanent effect on the future probability of a given type of response when similar stimulus conditions are present.</p><p>The two main classes of behavior are called "respondent" and "operant." Respondent behavior is "phylogenic": it is genetically-based, reflexive, and shared by all intact members of a species because over the course of the species' evolution it increased the likelihood of an individual organism's surviving to the point of reproduction. In technical terms, respondent behavior is said to be "elicited" by antecedent stimuli; such a response may be unlearned (unconditioned) such as blinking when dust hits the eye or salivating in the presence of appetizing food, or it may occur in the presence of previously neutral stimuli with which the unconditioned stimulus has been paired on a number of successive occasions. The latter type of response was demonstrated in Pavlov's famous classical conditioning experiments in which dogs, after experiencing so-called stimulus-stimulus pairing procedures, salivated upon hearing the sound of a bell (the conditioned stimulus). Operant behavior, in contrast, is "ontogenic": it is part of an individual's repertoire because over the course of their lifetime it has resulted in effective and adaptive changes in their immediate environment; in other words, an operant repertoire is learned behavior, selected by its history of consequences.</p><p>Operant conditioning-the ongoing development of an individual's unique repertoire as they interact with their environment-is characterized by automaticity: consequences exert selective effects on an individual's behavior irrespective of that person's awareness of, or ability to describe, the response-consequence relationship. Behavior analysts distinguish between the manner in which such consequences may be delivered: (a) they may be dispensed by another person (e.g., teachers praise correct answers to math problems), in which case they are socially mediated, or (b) they may come about as a direct result of an individual's action upon the environment (e.g., you press on the accelerator and the car speeds up), in which case they are automatic. Note that "automaticity" refers to the selective effect of the relevant consequences, while "automatic" refers to their mode of delivery.</p><p>Operant conditioning may result in one of two effects on the future probability of a given class of behavior: (a) it could become more likely to occur under similar conditions, which effect is called reinforcement, or (b) it could become less likely to occur under similar conditions, which effect is called punishment. It is important to note that the processes of reinforcement and punishment are defined functionally, which is to say without reference to their form and strictly by their effect upon future rates of a given response. Finally, reinforcement and punishment-the "up or down" direction of behavior change that occurs as a result of a given consequence-are further defined by the "in or out" direction of that consequence: if a consequence is presented, it is referred to as a positive event; if it is withdrawn, it is a negative event (note that these terms are directional and have nothing to do with valence). Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>To put it all together, "positive reinforcement" occurs when a behavior is followed by the presentation of a stimulus event and the future frequency of the behavior increases under similar environmental conditions. "Negative reinforcement" occurs when a behavior is followed by the removal of a stimulus event and the future frequency of the behavior increases under similar environmental conditions. Positive punishment occurs when a behavior is followed by the presentation of a stimulus event and the future frequency of the behavior decreases under similar environmental conditions. Negative punishment occurs when a behavior is followed by the removal of a stimulus event and the future frequency of the behavior decreases under similar environmental conditions. These are basic principles of behavior: they are descriptions of functional relation(s) between behavior and one or more of its associated environmental events, and they apply (i.e., have generality) across species, settings, and response classes.</p><p>Note that consequenceseither positive or negativeonly affect (a) the probability of future behavior, (b) under similar stimulus conditions. Together, these elements-(1) the specific antecedent stimuli that are present when the response is either reinforced or punished, (2) the type of response, and (3) given consequences -are known as the "three-term contingency," which is the basic unit of analysis in the study and influence of operant behavior. Note that we can only claim that particular consequences functioned to change the probability of a response if we observe it to occur more or less frequently on subsequent occasions when similar antecedent stimuli are present. If the rate of behavior does indeed change under similar conditions-and not under others-that response class is called a discriminated operant, and is said to be under stimulus control. Consequences are properly said to select response classes--not individuals/organisms. Reinforcing or punishing consequences are most effective when they are immediate. To the extent that a given consequence functions to affect a given response class, it will select any behavior that precedes it, whether or not a behavior change tactic is being practiced (automaticity). Behavior change tactics are the methods derived from one or more basic principles of behavior, analyzed with respect to the threeterm contingency, and utilized by applied behavior analysts.</p><p>Behavior analysis boils down to a few simple principles, but it is hardly a simplistic view of behavior. First, no two individuals will experience the selective action of consequences in identical ways under identical circumstances, and second, the principles interact in myriad ways. The scientific study of operant behavior is still relatively young, and it is helping us to understand such complexities as lengthy response chains, verbal behavior, motivating operations, and histories of reinforcement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Key Terms</head><p>1. Three potential target behaviors have been identified for Jackson, a 5-year-old boy with developmental disabilities. The three behaviors are: a) When walking to the bus with his teacher, Jackson will run across the street towards the bus to touch the wheels; b) When eating lunch, Jackson will chew with his mouth open, allowing some food to fall out of his mouth; and c) When playing in the sandbox at recess, Jackson will grab toys from other children and scream when they resist or try to reclaim the toy. Use the worksheet in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>.9 (p. 66) to prioritize these behaviors for treatment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 4: Measuring Behavior Chapter Summary</head><p>Measurement is the process of applying quantitative labels to observed properties of events using a standard set of rules. Scientists use measurement to operationalize empiricism. Applied behavior analysts measure behavior to answer questions about the existence and nature of functional relations between socially significant behavior and environmental variables. Practitioners use measurement to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and to guide decisions regarding treatment.</p><p>There are three dimensional qualities of behavior: repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus. Measures of repeatability include count, rate, and celeration. Temporal extent is measured by duration. Measures of temporal locus include latency and interresponse time. Derivative measures that combine two forms of data are frequently used in applied behavior analysis, including percentage and trials-to-criterion. Topography and magnitude provide useful information about behavior parameters though they are not fundamental dimensional qualities.</p><p>Behavior can be measured through direct methods, or through reviewing the permanent product produced by the behavior. Event recording, timing, and time sampling may be utilized individually or in combination, to measure directly observed behavior. Event recording encompasses a variety of procedures for detecting and recording the number of times a behavior is observed. Timing procedures use different timing devices (e.g., stopwatch) and procedures to measure duration, response latency, and interresponse time. Time sampling refers to a variety of methods for observing and recording behavior during intervals or at specific moments in time. Time sampling procedures include whole-interval, partial-interval, momentary, and planned activity check. If each instance of a behavior produces the same product, and that product is only produced by the behavior, these products can be recorded to measure the behavior. There are numerous low-tech and high-tech tools that may aid in data collection and analysis. High-tech options include digital devices, computer hardware, mobile apps, or software. Selection of the measurement method and tools should be based on behavior change goals, ease of behavior observation, measurement time and locale, and availability and skills of the recorder. </p></div>

Measurement validity exists when it is focused on a relevant dimension of a socially significant behavior and is obtained under conditions and during times most relevant to the reasons for measuring the behavior. Measurement is accurate when the observed values of an event match the true values of that event. Measurement is reliable when the same values are generated across repeated measurement of the same event.</p><p>A variety of factors can threaten the validity, reliability, and/or accuracy of measurement. Threats to measurement validity include indirect measurement, ill-suited behavioral dimensions, and measurement artifacts. Threats to measurement accuracy and reliability include human error, poorly designed measurement systems, inadequate observer training, observer drift, observer expectations, measurement bias, and reactivity.</p><p>Measuring the accuracy of data can help researchers and practitioners determine the usefulness of data for decision making, detect measurement errors, and communicate the trustworthiness of data. Accuracy is measured by comparing the observed measures to their true values. True values of behaviors can be universally accepted, established conditionally by context, or may have to be determined through processes that differ from the measurement of the target behavior. Reliability of data is a measure of the degree to which observers are consistently applying a valid and accurate system. It is assessed using natural or contrived permanent products.</p><p>Interobserver agreement (IOA) is the most common indicator of measurement quality in ABA. IOA is the degree to which two or more observers report the same observed values after measuring the same events. A variety of techniques exist for calculating IOA depending upon the recording method being used. The techniques vary in their complexity, stringency, and conservativeness. In order to minimize overestimation of agreement, more stringent and conservative methods of IOA calculation should be used. IOA should be collected and reported for all phases of a study. Reporting of IOA can also be combined with indices of accuracy and reliability to provide a more detailed assessment of the quality of the data. </p></div>

Simple graphs visually display relationships among and between behaviors and relevant environmental variables. Through the visual analysis of graphic displays of behavioral data, applied behavior analysts are able to answer questions related to the meaningfulness of behavior change, and make treatment or experimental decisions.</p><p>Graphic displays and visual analysis of behavioral data have several benefits over other displays of behavioral data.</p><p>Plotting data immediately following an observation period provides the practitioner with an ongoing and progressive record of participant behavior. Graphs are a simple and easily analyzable format for practitioners. Visual analysis of behavioral data is relatively easy to learn, is less time consuming, and does not rely on mathematical or statistical assumptions. Graphic displays and visual analyses help filter out the effects of weak variables and often allow for the identification of robust interventions. In addition, graphic displays of behavioral data encourage behavior analysts to draw their own conclusions based on patterns of behavior over time rather than relying on statistical manipulations. The visual representation of their own behavior may also serve as feedback for the individual whose behavior is being graphed.</p><p>There are several types of graphs used to display behavioral data in applied behavior analysis. The visual format selected depends on the type of raw data collected and the primary purpose of the evaluation. Commonly used graphic displays include equal-interval line graphs, bar graphs, cumulative records, ratio charts, and scatterplots. Line graphs are the format most commonly used by behavior analysts. The basic parts of a properly constructed line graph include accurately labeled vertical and horizontal axes, clearly placed and connected data points, appropriately placed condition lines and labels, and a descriptive figure caption. In addition, there is The Standard Celeration Chart, a six-cycle ratio scale which provides a standardized form of charting and assessing frequency of behavior across time.</p><p>Conducting visual analysis of graphed data enables behavior analysts to determine if socially significant behavior change has occurred, and if the independent variable is responsible for that change. Prior to visually analyzing data, behavior analysts should ensure that displays are constructed without distortion of the data. The process for conducting visual analyses includes assessment of: 1) the number of data points, 2) the variability of the data, 3) the level of performance, and 4) the direction and slope of the trend of the data within a condition. The significance of change in trend, level, and/or variability between conditions can be determined through a visual analysis. </p></div>

The article includes a discussion surrounding the accuracy of different methods, training to improve the accuracy of visual analysis, and a description of how to train large groups in the interpretation of singlecase designs.</p><p>Chapter Activities Scientific investigations provide three levels of understanding: description, prediction, and control. The goal of experimental analyses in applied behavior analysis is to understand socially significant behaviors. Experimental analyses are conducted to investigate the changes in behavior in relation to environmental events manipulated by the experimenter. Experimental control is demonstrated when a predictable change in the dependent variable (behavior of interest) can be reliably produced by the experimenter making systematic changes in the independent variable (environmental event).</p><p>Applied behavior analysts are interested in the behavior of individual organisms and primarily utilize within-subject (or single-case) methods of analysis with repeated measures over time. In behavior analytic research, suspected determinants of variability are isolated, then experimentally manipulated to better understand their role in variable responding. Determinism is a major assumption of behavior analysis.</p><p>Single-case research designs are the most commonly used designs in applied behavior analysis. Components of behavior analytic experiments include the research question, at least one dependent variable, precise manipulation of the independent variable, careful observation and measurement, and ongoing visual inspection of resulting data patterns. Behavior analysts employ steady state strategy (i.e., ensuring stable responding in any given condition, before introducing changes to that condition) and baseline logic in the evaluation of behavior change over time.</p><p>Baseline logic includes three elements: prediction, verification, and replication. Baseline levels of responding are established as an objective basis for evaluating the effects of the independent variable. The heart of baseline logic is the inductive proposition known as "affirmation of the consequent"-in this case, the notion that if an independent variable "A" influences behavior then its presentation will lead to a change, "B," in behavior. A successful experimental design leads to increasing confidence in the effect of the independent variable each time it confirms a given "if A-then-B" relationship.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 8: Reversal and Multielement Designs Chapter Summary</head><p>This chapter focuses on two experimental tactics commonly used in applied behavior analysis research: the reversal design and the multielement design. Minimally, the reversal design entails three conditions: A (non-intervention baseline); B (treatment); A (a repeat of the non-intervention condition). A functional relation is demonstrated when an abrupt change occurs with the onset of treatment and then reverts back to the initial condition with the onset of the second non-intervention condition. This design is strengthened considerably when the B (treatment) condition is reintroduced and the level once again approximates the initial B (treatment) condition.</p><p>The B-A-B design is used when it is impractical or unethical to employ an A-B-A or A-B-A-B design. Introducing the B condition first is not ideal experimentally because doing so removes the opportunity to obtain a baseline measure. By not introducing the A condition first, the experimenter forfeits the opportunity to obtain a baseline measure known to be free from the influence of the intervention. For this reason, the B-A-B, experimentally, is less preferred than the A-B-A design. A sequence effect occurs when an intervention condition influences behavior in a subsequent condition, thus resulting in a threat to internal validity.</p><p>With the multielement design, two or more conditions (e.g., one baseline condition and two interventions conditions) are rapidly alternated. The two data series are plotted on the same graph with each series representing its own baseline or intervention condition. A functional relation is demonstrated when the target behavior is consistently at a different level under the one condition than it is under the other condition. A two-phase version of this design begins with only a baseline condition, followed by subsequent alternating treatment conditions.</p><p>The adapted alternating treatments design similarly begins with a baseline condition, but then applies two different teaching interventions to two topographically different but equivalent sets of skills. Other variations include a threephase design, wherein a baseline condition is followed by alternating treatment conditions, which is then followed by the best (i.e., most effective) condition or the participant's choice condition.</p><p>A concurrent chains (or concurrent schedule) design has two or more interventions running simultaneously. The participant selects under which contingencies they will operate. Dependent measures reflect the amount of engagement in one condition versus the other(s). Consistently more engagement in one condition provides evidence of that condition being preferred.</p></div>

In a multiple baseline design, data are collected during simultaneous baseline conditions for two or more behaviors. After stable responding has been achieved, the independent variable is applied to one of the behaviors while baseline conditions are maintained for the other behaviors. After change has been observed in the first behavior, the independent variable is applied sequentially to each behavior in the design. Experimental control is demonstrated when behavior change corresponds with the onset of the independent variable for each behavior. Three basic types of multiple baseline designs are (a) multiple baseline across different behaviors of the same individual, (b) multiple baseline across the same behavior of different individuals, and (c) multiple baseline of the same behavior of one individual across different settings.</p><p>Variations of the multiple baseline design include a multiple probe design, a delayed multiple baseline design, and a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design. Multiple probe designs begin with the standard baseline conditions for all behaviors. Once stability is achieved, intermittent measures are taken at the beginning of the experiment and thereafter each time a subject has mastered one of the behaviors or sequential skills. This design is useful for evaluating the effect of instruction on skill sequences when it is unlikely that the skill will improve without instruction, in addition to situations where a prolonged baseline could have negative effects. For delayed multiple baseline designs, baseline conditions for subsequent behaviors begin at some point following the onset of baseline measurement for earlier behaviors. Each subsequent baseline condition must start prior to earlier behaviors beginning intervention in order for experimental control to be demonstrated. This design may be used when a planned reversal is no longer possible, resources are limited, or a new behavior or participant becomes available. Nonconcurrent multiple baseline designs, the weakest variation, consist of multiple A-B designs with different participants and periods of time. The varying baseline conditions of the nonconcurrent multiple baseline design inhibit the verification element of baseline logic from being met by this design.</p><p>In order for experimental control to be achieved through use of a multiple baseline design, behaviors of interest must be functionally independent and share a reasonable likelihood of responding to the independent variable. Behaviors must also be measured concurrently and interventions cannot be applied to the next behavior until the previous behavior change has been established. There should be a significant difference in the length of baseline conditions between the different behaviors and the independent variable should first be applied to the behavior demonstrating the greatest level of stable responding in baseline.</p><p>Advantages of the multiple baseline design include: 1) withdrawing a potentially effective intervention is not required, 2) the pattern is similar to typical practices of many teachers and clinicians, 3) generalization of behavior change is monitored, and 4) the ease of conceptualization and implementation. Limitations of the design include: 1) potential false negatives if behaviors are not functionally independent, 2) weaker demonstrations of experimental control, 3) evaluates the independent variable's general effectiveness rather than an analysis of the behaviors selected for study, and 4) requires considerable time and resources.</p><p>Changing criterion designs can be used to evaluate the effects of a treatment on the gradual or stepwise improvement of a behavior already in the individual's repertoire. After a stable baseline has been observed, the first intervention phase begins. Reinforcement is typically contingent upon performance at a specified level. The design entails a series of intervention phases, each requiring improved performance. Experimental control is demonstrated when behavior conforms to the criterion changes. Range-bound changing criterion designs include low and high criterion points, between which responding may fall during each phase. Two advantages of this design are that it does not require withdrawal of a seemingly effective treatment and that it enables experimental analysis within the context of a gradually improving behavior. Two limitations of the design are that the target behavior must already be in the subject's repertoire and that the necessary features of the design may impede the natural learning rate.</p><p>Flexibility in experimental design is important because it allows the researcher to address questions of interest using the most appropriate design or design combinations. A good research design is one that manipulates the relevant variables in a manner that produces data to convincingly answer the research question(s). Often, this may require a combination of analytic tactics. Effective designs rely on continual analysis of data from individual subjects as the basis for evaluation.</p><p>The validity and reliability of a research study are measured by examining the internal, social, and external validity of its treatment and outcomes. Internal validity refers to the extent to which an experiment shows convincingly that changes in the behavior are a result of the independent variable. Designs with a high degree of internal validity demonstrate a reliable intervention effect and minimize the possibility that the effect was due to factors other than the independent variable. Treatment integrity and procedural reliability are two measures of internal validity and refer to the extent to which the independent variable was implemented as planned. Social validity refers to the social significance of the target behavior, the acceptability of the intervention procedures, and the social importance of the outcomes. Assessment of social validity typically includes evaluation of consumer opinion as well as expert evaluation, normative comparisons, standardized tests, and real-world application of leaned skills in the natural environment. External validity refers to the degree to which a functional relationship found in a given experiment will hold under different circumstances, such as in other settings, with other populations, and with other behaviors.</p><p>In applied behavior analysis external validity or research generality is assessed through direct and systematic replication of experiments.</p><p>The chapter concludes with a discussion of the importance of evaluating applied behavior analysis research to establish the quality and value of the results. Evaluation of research should include consideration of all aspects of the experiment, from the technological description, to the interpretation of the findings. As importantly, the conceptual framework of the study should be evaluated for its scientific merit. Although all conceptual criteria for quality are important, it is unlikely and unnecessary that each experiment meet all the standards to be considered worthwhile. ✓ IOA data per subject and in each condition were collected and averaged in the 90% range.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 11: Positive Reinforcement</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>Positive reinforcement occurs when a behavior is followed by the presentation of a stimulus which increases the future occurrence of the behavior. The stimulus that is presented following the behavior is the positive reinforcer. Reinforcement works best when the reinforcer is presented contingent upon and immediately after the response. A commonly held misconception regarding reinforcement is that it involves circular reasoning. Reinforcement is not a circular concept because the two components of the response-consequence relation can be separated. Further, the consequence can be manipulated to determine if it increases the frequency of the behavior it follows.</p><p>Antecedent stimuli (i.e., discriminative stimuli and motivating operations) are integral to the efficacy of reinforcement, which leads to the discriminated operant (the four-term contingency, EO  S D  R  S R+ ).</p><p>Motivation is key to the efficacy of a particular reinforcer at a specific point in time. That is, the reinforcer will only be effective if the learner wants or is willing to work for it. One is also more likely to engage in a behavior when in the presence of stimuli with which reinforcement has been provided.</p><p>Several characteristics are associated with the process of reinforcement. The automaticity of reinforcement refers to the fact that an individual does not need to know about or be aware of a reinforcement contingency for it to effective. Reinforcement is arbitrary; it does not have to be intentional or specifically reserved for certain target behaviors. Any behavior can be selected for increase via the process of reinforcement, including both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Automaticity of reinforcement should not be confused with automatic reinforcement. Automatic reinforcement means a reinforcing consequence occurs without social mediation.</p><p>Reinforcing stimuli are organized via specific classifications and behavior analyst have specific procedures aimed at identifying potential reinforcers for use with learners. Reinforcers are classified as unconditioned (those that do not require a learning history to acquire reinforcing properties) or conditioned (those that acquired reinforcing properties via pairing with other reinforcers). Reinforcers may also be classified by their formal properties -edible, sensory, tangible, activity, or social. Methods to identify potential reinforcers are called stimulus preference assessments. They include simply asking the individual/others about preferred items and activities, as well as more systematic approaches. Trial-based assessments include single-stimulus, paired stimulus, and multiple-stimulus with and without replacement. Reinforcer assessments are different from preference assessments, as they directly assess the reinforcement efficacy of a stimulus with a target behavior.</p><p>In addition to their use as a major component of behavior analytic interventions, reinforcement procedures have proven to be a valuable alternative to escape extinction as a control condition when evaluating reinforcement-based interventions. Some of these procedures include noncontingent reinforcement, differential reinforcement of other behavior, and differential reinforcement of alternative behavior. There are nine guidelines practitioners should consider when using reinforcement whether in the context of a specific intervention or to demonstrate experimental control. Over the course of three experiments, this study compared the correspondence of results from preference questionnaires to computerized paired stimulus preference assessments and evaluated the reinforcement efficacy of stimuli indicated as highly preferred during the preference assessments with children in foster care. Results indicated the children engaged more often with items identified as highly preferred during competing stimulus arrangements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 12: Negative Reinforcement</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>Negative reinforcement can be thought of as a complementary process to positive reinforcement. With positive reinforcement, responding increases as a result of the presentation of a stimulus following behavior. Whereas with negative reinforcement, responding increases due to the termination of a stimulus following behavior. Within this chapter, negative reinforcement is further contrasted with the processes of positive reinforcement and punishment.</p><p>The process of negative reinforcement may appear simple according to its definition. As one might notice, the definition of negative reinforcement directly aligns with the escape contingency. However, avoidance contingencies are also applicable to negative reinforcement. With avoidance, responding prevents or delays the presentation of an aversive stimulus. That is, with the avoidance contingency, it is possible for the aversive stimulus to never be present. This characteristic of the avoidance paradigm does not follow an A-B-C arrangement. The potential absence of a clear antecedent appears to be conceptually inconsistent with the framework for operant behavior.</p><p>Negative reinforcement is characterized by the presence of contextual features and/or antecedent events that create an EO for their removal. The removal of these events plays a necessary role in negative reinforcement. This is illustrated with examples involving the strengthening of both adaptive and problem behavior.</p><p>Strategies aimed at addressing problem behavior maintained by negative reinforcement include the use of extinction and differential negative reinforcement. While the focus tends to be on the behavior of students/clients, negative reinforcement contingencies also exerts control over the behavior of teachers/caregivers and their interactions with the students/clients. In addition to the direct effects of negative reinforcement on teacher/caregiver behavior, one must also consider ethical issues that may arise when using negative reinforcement. These issues are primarily related to the use of an aversive condition as an EO and the potential severity of the condition that is necessary to occasion the target behavior. Another concern is related to the potential side effects of negative reinforcement, such as the occurrence of emotional behaviors similar to those associated with the use of punishment procedures.  5.

Conditioning of social interaction consisted of noncontingent deliveries of leisure and edible items. Stimulus fading consisted of gradually and systematically introducing proximity, verbal attention, and physical attention to the participant. Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior plus extinction (DRA+EXT) included delivering praise and an edible contingent on appropriate interactions and extinction for problem behavior.</p><p>Results indicated that only the DRA+EXT intervention was consistently effective at increasing social interactions and reducing problem behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 13: Schedules of Reinforcement</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>A schedule of reinforcement is a rule that establishes the probability that a specific occurrence of a behavior will produce reinforcement. Two basic schedules of reinforcement -continuous reinforcement and extinction -provide the boundaries for all other possible schedules. With continuous reinforcement (CRF), a behavior is reinforced every time it occurs. The other schedule of reinforcement is called extinction (EXT) because no occurrence of the behavior is reinforced.</p><p>Between continuous reinforcement and extinction, a variety of schedules exist whereby some instances of a behavior are reinforced, and other occurrences of the same behavior are not reinforced. These specific environmental arrangements are called intermittent schedules of reinforcement (INT).</p><p>Basic intermittent schedules include ratio or interval arrangements where reinforcement deliveries occur via a fixed or variable contingency. They combine to form four basic intermittent schedules of reinforcementfixed ratio (FR), variable ratio (VR), fixed interval (FI), and variable interval (VI). Each of these schedules is associated with a unique response pattern. Variations of basic intermittent reinforcement schedules include differential reinforcement of rates of responding (DRH, DRL, DRD), lag schedules, and progressive schedules (progressive ratio and delay to reinforcement schedules).</p><p>The combination of two or more basic schedules of reinforcement make up a compound schedule. Compound schedules can occur simultaneously or successively and with or without discriminative stimuli. Reinforcement can also be contingent on the completion of individual components of the schedule or the entire combined schedule. The components of compound schedules vary along these parameters to form specific types of compound schedules. As with the basic intermittent reinforcement schedules, some types of compound schedules also yield unique response patterns. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Compare and contrast fixed and variable ratio schedules.</head><p>As with reinforcement, there are unconditioned and conditioned punishers. Unconditioned punishers are stimuli that are inherently aversive. Conditioned punishers become aversive due to pairing with other punishers. Generalized conditioned punishers have been paired with a variety of punishers and function as punishers regardless of a specific MO. Also, like reinforcement, punishment is sensitive to antecedent stimulus conditions, i.e., the presence/absence of a discriminative stimulus for punishment (S Dp ).</p><p>When positive punishment procedures are used properly, they are likely to result in rapid, long-term suppression of problem behavior. However, there are negative side effects to using punishment, including the individual's engagement in emotional and aggressive behavior. One might react to receiving punishment by attempting to escape or avoid the punishment and the setting where the punishment is carried out. Modeling undesirable behavior can be an issue, such as when children who receive spankings imitate the hitting behavior displayed by their parents. Punishing agents may be at risk of overusing punishment procedures due to their punishing behavior being negatively reinforced. Further, actions that are often intended to be punishing (e.g., reprimands) may alternatively function as reinforcers.</p><p>Examples of positive punishment interventions include, reprimands, response blocking, response interruption and redirection (RIRD), contingent exercise, and overcorrection. Specific factors that influence the efficacy of punishment include their immediacy, intensity, schedule, and consistency. The presence of competing reinforcers impacts how effective a punisher is for a specific target behavior. Reinforcing an alternative behavior combined with punishment of the target behavior is likely to increase the efficacy of a punishment procedure.</p><p>Punishment procedures are particularly useful, a) with severe, dangerous behaviors that need to be quickly addressed, b) when reinforcement-based procedures have been unsuccessful in addressing the behavior, or c) when one is unable to identify or withhold the reinforcer for problem behavior. Strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of punishment include conducting punisher assessments, using high-quality and a variety of punishers, delivering punishment immediately and consistently, and combining punishment with reinforcement-based procedures. Ethical considerations when using punishment include the client's safe and humane treatment and the use of effective and the least restrictive procedures. Those within the field of applied behavior analysis believe that by recognizing, appreciating, and seeking knowledge about the role of punishment within our natural world we build a more complete and effective science of behaviorism. Punishment should never be used as a default behavior change strategy. Instead, measures should be taken to use less restrictive and less aversive strategies when possible. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>Punishment is defined as a reduction in behavior due to a stimulus change following a behavior. With negative punishment, a stimulus is removed following the behavior resulting in future decreases in the behavior. The implementation of negative punishment by behavior analysts consists of two strategies: time-out from positive reinforcement and response cost. Time-out from positive reinforcement involves removing one's access to positive reinforcers or withdrawing one's opportunity to earn positive reinforcement for a specific period of time contingent on behavior. Response cost involves taking away previously earned reinforcers contingent on behavior. Time-out procedures consists of either non-exclusion or exclusionary methods. With non-exclusion time-out, the individual remains within the physical setting. However, reinforcing aspects of the setting are altered so the individual loses access to specific reinforcers or loses the opportunity to earn them. Common forms of nonexclusion time-out include planned ignoring, terminate specific reinforcer contact, contingent observation, and partition/select space time-out. With exclusion time-out, the individual is physically separated from the reinforcement setting (the time-in environment). This is done in two ways: removing the individual from the time-in setting or removing the time-in setting from the individual. Desirable aspects of time-out include its ease of application, acceptability to practitioners, rapid suppression of the target behavior, and ability to be combined with other procedures.</p><p>Response cost can be thought of as a fine for the individual's engagement in problem behavior. It typically involves the loss of generalized conditioned reinforcers or the loss of time with a preferred activity. When implemented with generalized conditioned reinforcers, response cost may involve fines against an individual's previously earned reinforcers (e.g., loses a token that had been earned) or a fine against a stockpile of noncontingently earned reinforcers (e.g., loses a portion of recess time for each behavior). Desirable aspects of response cost include its efficacy, it is a least restrictive punishment procedure, its convenience, its ability to be combined with other procedures, and its social validity. The effective use of response cost involves stating the rules regarding which behaviors will be fined, when the fine will occur, and the amount of the fine. Further, when multiple behaviors are targeted with response cost, the amount of each fine should vary based on the severity of the target behavior. Fines should be large enough to suppress the problem behavior but not so large that they bankrupt the system.</p><p>As with all punishment procedures, the use of time-out and response cost should be considered after initially considering nonpunitive methods. A practitioner's effective implementation of either procedure should involve several considerations prior to, during, and after implementation. The effective use of time-out involves enriching the time-in environment, operationally defining the target behavior, determining which procedure to use and obtaining permission to use it, explaining the rules regarding the procedure, determining the length of the time-out interval, applying the procedure consistently, and establishing the exit criterion. Additionally, the practitioner should ensure the procedure complies with legal and ethical guidelines, evaluate its efficacy, and eventually terminate the time-out program. The effective use of response cost involves clearly stating the target behavior, as well as the timing and amount of fines. With bonus response cost, be sure there is a sufficient reinforcer reserve to keep up with reinforcer loses. Also, with response cost, one should be prepared to address unplanned outcomes, be careful to not overuse the procedure, and keep a record of acquired reinforcers and fines. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>The term motivating operation (MO) is an all-inclusive term for an antecedent event with two main effects: a) it alters the efficacy of a specific stimulus as a reinforcer or punisher (value-altering effect), and b) it temporarily alters the frequency of behavior that has been reinforced or punished by that stimulus (behavior-altering effect). MOs are primarily classified according to the direction of their effect on the reinforcer/punisher. Establishing operations (EO) increase the reinforcement or punishment efficacy of a stimulus. Abolishing operations (AO) decrease reinforcer and punisher efficacy.</p><p>Motivating operations have both direct and indirect effects on behavior and stimuli. The behavior-altering effect of the MO directly evokes or abates the behavior. However, the MO indirectly affects an S D 's ability to evoke and abate behavior. Additionally, the value-altering effect of the MO indirectly influences the efficacy of conditioned reinforcers and punishers. The manner in which MOs and S D s interact with behavior and stimuli is integral to determining whether a specific antecedent is one or the other. S D s evoke and abate behavior due to a historical correlation between their presence/absence and the differential availability of specific consequences. MOs evoke and abate behavior due to the relation between their presence/absence and the differential efficacy of the specific consequence.</p><p>In addition to the primary classifications of EO and AO, MOs are either unconditioned (UMO) or conditioned (CMO). Unconditioned motivating operations have value-altering effects that are unlearned. That is, UMOs are those with which the organism needs no prior learning history. Unconditioned motivating operations for humans include deprivation and satiation related to water, food, oxygen, activity, sleep, and sexual stimulation, in addition to changes in temperature and painful stimulation. Conditioned motivating operations have value-altering effects that are the result of the organism's learning history. There are three types of CMOs: surrogate (CMO-S), reflexive (CMO-R), and transitive (CMO-T). Surrogate CMOs acquire their effects via pairing with UMOs. Reflexive CMOs are those with which their own offset functions as a reinforcer. Transitive CMOs establish other stimuli as effective reinforcers or punishers.</p><p>The role of MOs within applied behavior analysis is significant, as the efficacy of various reinforcers depends on their presence. The behavior analyst's ability to effectively assess, treat, maintain, and generalize behavior is tied to the practitioner's ability to manipulate relevant MOs. 10. Discuss the general implications for the use of motivating operations within the study of behavior analysis.</p></div>

The author examined specific aspects of the paper, such as Michael's use of colloquial terms and his distinctions between specific types of establishing operations. This study set up two conditions prior to conducting generalization probes for newly taught mands. Participants had presession access to a preferred item until they rejected it (abolishing operation) or did not have presession access to an item (establishing operation). Results indicated that more manding followed the presession no access condition compared to the presession access condition. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 17: Stimulus Control Chapter Summary</head><p>This chapter reviews the basic concepts and processes involved in stimulus control and the development of stimulus control. It concludes with a discussion of effective methods for transferring stimulus control from artificial response and stimulus prompts to natural occurring stimuli.</p><p>Stimulus control is defined as a change in rate, latency, duration, or amplitude of the response in the presence of specific stimuli referred to as the discriminative stimulus or S D . Stimulus discrimination is achieved when the organism responds only when the S D is present and not in its absence (stimulus delta, S  condition). The S D evokes behavior because it has been correlated with the differential availability of reinforcement. Stimulus generalization refers to the ability of other stimuli that share similar properties with the S D to evoke the same behavior. The degree to which stimulus discrimination and generalization occur varies and is graphically depicted in a stimulus generalization gradient. Faulty stimulus control can occur when a behavior comes under the restricted control of an irrelevant antecedent stimulus. The evocative function of an establishing operation (EO) differs from that of an S D in that it evokes behavior by changing the efficacy of a reinforcer rather than signaling the differential availability of reinforcement. The S D acquires its controlling function for operant behavior by being paired with stimulus changes that follow the behavior whereas the controlling function for respondent behavior comes from pairing a neutral stimulus with the antecedent stimulus that elicits the behavior.</p><p>Stimulus discrimination training entails reinforcing responses in the presence of one stimulus condition (S D ) and not in another condition (S  ). Match-to-sample procedures are used to teach stimulus discriminations, which are referred to as "conditional discriminations" because the discrimination between the comparison stimulus is conditional or depends on the sample stimuli presented at each trial. An example of complex stimulus control occurs in learning concepts. A concept is a stimulus class where each example must share one or more common features. Concepts can function within feature stimulus classes (common physical forms or relative relations are shared) or arbitrary stimulus class (do not share physical forms or relative relations). Both discrimination between and generalization within a stimulus class are required to learn concepts.</p><p>In learning a discrimination, prompts can be used and serve as supplemental stimuli to occasion the correct response in the presence of the S D . Response prompts (e.g., instructions, modeling, physical guidance) operate directly on the response to cue the desired behavior and stimulus prompts (e.g., exaggerating, redundancy, position of stimuli) operate directly on the antecedent task stimuli to cue the correct response in conjunction with the S D . Several factors may inhibit the development of stimulus control, including lack of pre-attending skills, stimulus salience, masking, and overshadowing.</p><p>Response prompts and stimulus prompts are used during the acquisition phase and should then be faded so that stimulus control is transferred to the relevant natural stimuli. For response prompts, this can be done through mostto-least prompt sequences, graduated guidance, least-to-most prompt sequences, and time delay procedures. To fade stimulus prompts, the exaggerated features of stimuli are gradually reduced until the relevant stimulus has been returned to its original state.    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 18: Verbal Behavior Chapter Summary</head><p>There are two major sections in this chapter. The first is a review of the core elements in Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior. The second is a description of the application of verbal behavior to language assessment and intervention for individuals with autism and intellectual and developmental disabilities. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the use of Skinner's analysis as a model for assessment and intervention for those who have lost verbal behavior.</p><p>Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior emphasizes the function of language, arguing that the meaning of language comes from the immediate and historical environmental contingencies that evoke and consequate speaker and listener behavior. Skinner defined verbal behavior as behavior reinforced through the mediation of another person, who in turn is conditioned to reinforce the behavior of the speaker. Using this definition, expressive language is viewed as resulting from three separate sources of antecedent controlmotivating variables, non-verbal S D s, and verbal S D sand the history of consequences. This provides the framework for classifying five different types of expressive language (elementary verbal operants). Receptive language is the behavior of the listener and is characterized as nonverbal discriminations controlled by verbal S D s. However, much of listener behavior is also verbal (e.g., covert self-talk) and should be treated as verbal behavior in these instances. As language involves an interaction between the speaker and listener, the basic unit of analysis is the verbal episode.</p><p>Mands are a type of verbal behavior where the form of the response is under the functional control of a motivating operation and its specific reinforcement. For a complete accounting of language, the behavior of the listener needs to be considered. In a verbal episode, a speaker emits verbal behavior and the listener serves as an audience, provides reinforcement to the speaker, and responds to the speaker's specific verbal behavior. Untrained emergent listener relations can also develop through response and stimulus generalization because the listener is an active responder. The assessment of language skills is essential for identifying specific problem areas, comparing skills to expected language norms, and providing guidance for remedial intervention. Using a verbal behavior approach, language assessment entails measuring the strength of the elementary verbal operants, listener skills, self-listener skills, multiply controlled responding, and speaker-listener interactions. This study evaluates the use of a teaching strategy that produced generalized language acquisition responding.</p><p>This study evaluated a teaching strategy for children who use Picture Exchange Communication Systems (PECS) and who may not have the necessary picture card in their picture binders. Children were taught descriptive words to evaluate whether the descriptions would be used when the correct picture was missing. Results indicated that the teaching strategy promoted improvisation in the children when the correct picture card was absent. Generalization within classes of description (e.g., color) occurred, but generalization across classes did not occur readily. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>Behavior analysts have studied stimulus equivalence in an attempt to explain symbolic functioning since work by Sidman was published <ref type="bibr">(1971)</ref>. Stimulus equivalence procedures involve training and testing conditions, during which match-to-sample procedures are commonly used. Following baseline conditions, two interrelated conditional discriminations (e.g., AB and BC) are trained with arbitrary, physically dissimilar stimuli. Training steps include: 1) presentation of a sample stimulus (e.g., A1 or A2); 2) presentation of multiple comparison stimuli (e.g., B1 and B2) contingent on an observing response to the sample; and 3) reinforcement contingent on selection of the correct comparison stimulus (e.g., B1 when the sample is A1). Following training, trials are conducted without reinforcement to probe for the emergence of reflexivity (i.e., generalized identity matching like AA, BB, and CC), symmetry (i.e., reversal of sample-comparison functions like BA and CB), and transitivity (i.e., relations between stimuli that were not presented together during training like AC and CA). Positive demonstration of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity supports the conclusion that an equivalence class has formed, and each member of the class (e.g., A, B, and C) will have the same effect on behavior.</p><p>The emergence of untrained relations resulting from stimulus equivalence enhances the significance of equivalencebased instruction (EBI) to learning. Key outcomes that add to the effectiveness of EBI include: 1) formation of equivalence classes resulting from testing and probing; 2) delayed emergence (i.e., equivalence performance is frequently strengthened with repeated testing; 3) class expansion (i.e., new stimuli joining the class following training of relation with one member of the class); 4) class merger (i.e., combination of classes following training of relation between one member of each class); 5) transfer of function (i.e., all members of the class having the same effect on behavior following training with one member of the class; and 6) emergence of contextual control (i.e., a five term contingency allows for stimuli to be members of more than one stimulus class).</p><p>Procedures for EBI must be geared toward successful generation of equivalence classes and prevention of problematic stimulus-control. Critical decisions for match-to-sample training procedures include: 1) number and type of stimuli, 2) mode of stimulus presentation, 3) inclusion and type of observing response, 4) content of the instructions, 5) arrangement of trial presentations, 6) special training steps, 7) training structure, 8) mastery criteria for training, and 9) consequences for training. Critical decisions for testing procedures include: 1) composition of probe-trial blocks, 2) arrangement of consequences, 3) order of probe-type presentations, and 4) the criteria to be used for judging class formation.</p><p>Variations in the standard match-to-sample training and testing approach to equivalence include: 1) stimulus compounds (i.e., multiple-part sample stimuli in a match-to-sample procedure with each part becoming a member of the equivalence class); 2) class-specific reinforcement (i.e., reinforcer for correct responding differs between intended classes with the specified reinforcer functioning as a member of the class); and 3) three-term contingency training (i.e., training simple discriminations can produce equivalence-class formation). Application of EBI has been demonstrated across populations, settings, and targets. These procedures have been effective for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, young typically developing children, adults receiving clinical services, geriatric populations, and college students. Teaching targets have included: number skills, language skills, music skills, academic skills, Braille reading, health-related behaviors, skills impacted by traumatic brain injury, and university-course content.</p><p>Naming theory and relational frame theory (RFT) have been proposed as alternative accounts for derived relational responding. Naming theorists suggest the higher-order speaker-listener operant (i.e., naming) is responsible for all class formation, including equivalence class formation. In contrast, relational frame theory suggests the higher-order operant is framing (i.e., responding to one stimulus in terms of another). Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 20: Engineering Emergent Learning with Nonequivalence Relations Chapter Summary</head><p>Operant behavior occurs under the control of particular sets of stimuli. Some stimuli that participate in various contingencies may become arbitrarily related in a class: they share no formal similarities, in other words, but similar responses occur in their presence because of contingencies of reinforcement established by the verbal community. Perhaps the best known of these relationships is stimulus equivalence: stimuli become members of a class by virtue of "sameness," in terms of the responses they evoke (chapter 19). Further, some stimuli that become related as "same" may evoke responding without behavior ever having been directly reinforced in their presence. This cannot be considered stimulus generalization because the evocative stimuli bear no formal similarity. Rather, it is considered to be an emergent or derived relation.</p><p>Stimuli may be related in many ways other than "sameness." The terms with which we have become familiar for discussing equivalence relations, therefore, apply to just one type of relation among many, and this fact points to the need for a more general set of overarching terms. "Symmetry," for example, refers to a bidirectional relationship demonstrated by a learner who, when taught some form of "If A then B," may derive the response "if B then A" without additional instruction (e.g., being taught to match the written word "cat" to a photo of a cat, the child can match the photo to the written word). According to relational frame theory (RFT), however, bidirectionality may be observed in other relationships such as those of "distinction," "temporal" and "spatial," and "cause-effect." Opposition, for instance, is a type of distinction: if a learner is taught that "big" is the opposite of "small," they may-given the right learning history-identify "small" as the opposite of "big" with no further training. Bidirectional relationships of this type are called "mutual entailment."</p><p>Another term in the equivalence literature is "transitivity," which refers to a situation in which two stimuli, "B" and "C," are responded to as being the same, by virtue of their having been separately taught to be associated with a third stimulus, "A." Within RFT, "combinatorial entailment" is the more general term for a derived relation in which the function of a given stimulus depends on other stimuli to which it is related.</p><p>It is important to note that the same stimuli can be brought into many different classes and relations: think about a stack of photos of produce, that may be sorted according to how they grow, how they are harvested, season of availability, means of preparation, botanical classification, or simply shape or color. The way in which the stimuli in this example are related is under the control of contextual stimuli. For instance, a "cat's paw" is a curved implement for pulling nails from lumber; you would probably go to your toolbox and produce this tool if asked for one by the foreman on a construction site, but it would be surprising if you did so when your veterinarian said, "Show me your cat's paw."</p><p>If symmetry and transitivity are special cases of mutual and combinatorial entailment, it is tempting to suppose by analogy that relational frame theory is a broader form of Sidman's theory of stimulus equivalence. Both are overarching accounts of observed phenomena that cohere with respect to basic principles, but there is an important difference: Sidman maintained that derived relations necessarily were an automatic outcome of specific reinforcement contingencies, whereas RFT assumes that "deriving" is a generalized operant that develops, much like generalized imitation, as the outcome of a particular learning history that is characterized by multiple-exemplar training.</p><p>Relational frame theory posits that (a) derived stimulus relations are essentially verbal processes, and (b) given enough reinforced experience with multiple examples, people develop a higher-order skill to derive relations among given sets of stimuli in the absence of further reinforced experience. The resulting generalized repertoire, in the parlance of RFT, is called arbitrarily applicable relational responding; any specific type of relation-forms of distinction or deictic relations, for example-is called a relational frame.</p><p>Certain broad types of relation may represent classes of behavior that are essentially tacted by big-picture psychological constructs: "Categorical knowledge," which is manifested in hierarchical relations; "self-concept," which is represented in deictic relations that are central to the socially important skill of perspective-shifting; and intellectual development, which seems to track with verbal skills and increasingly sophisticated forms of relational Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>responding (indeed, systematically training stimulus relations has been shown to increase scores of a variety of learners on standardized intelligence tests).</p><p>Another area of human experience in which RFT has made an impact is personal "well-being," defined as behaving in ways that make contact with one's most valued reinforcers. Sometimes individuals behave in ways that interfere with optimal well-being, and precepts of RFT, such as transformation of function and the examination of rulegoverned behavior, may shed light on mechanisms that account for the interfering behavior. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a behavior therapy predicated in part on RFT and on research in derived relations. The treatment methods employed by ACT often focus on private events and depart significantly from applied behavior analysis as conventionally conceived and practiced-they do not target discrete observable target behavior or systematically manipulate externally arranged consequences, for instance-but they have been evaluated experimentally and have been shown to improve not only such complaints as self-reported anxiety and depression (and associated symptoms) but also, in some cases, to have an impact on over problem behavior. These technological departures may be uncomfortable for some behavior analysts but they are grounded in behavioral principles and ripe for additional research. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 21: Modeling, Imitation, and Observational Learning Chapter Summary</head><p>A behavior is considered imitative if: 1) it follows a model (i.e., another person's demonstration of the behavior); 2) the model and the evoked behavior "look the same" (i.e., have formal similarity); 3) there is a slight delay between the model and the evoked behavior; and 4) the model serves as the controlling variable for the evoked behavior.</p><p>Learners can be taught to imitate using systematic, researched based procedures with the goal of establishing generalized imitation. Streifel (1974) recommended the following imitation training sequence: 1) assessing and teaching prerequisite skills, 2) selecting models, 3) pretesting, 4) sequencing models for training, and 5) performing imitation training. Guidelines for imitation training include: 1) keep sessions active and brief, 2) reinforcing prompted and imitative responses, 3) pairing praise and attention with tangible reinforcers, 4) backing up and move ahead slowly if progress stalls, 5) fading out prompts, and 6) measuring and reviewing the data after each session.</p><p>Once generalized imitation has been acquired, modeling procedures, including video modeling, can be a strategy for learners to acquire new skills by imitating. The most effective modeling procedures include the following elements: 1) similarities between the model and learner, 2) models that the learner admires, 3) emphasis on critical aspects of the behavior, 4) prompting attending to the model, 5) model in authentic context, 6) feedback immediately following practiced response, and 7) reinforcement of imitative response.</p><p>When another person's behavior and its consequence are observed, and that information is used to determine whether or not to imitate the behavior, it is considered observational learning. Observational learning involves imitation or non-imitation of the observed response. The skills required to developing an observational learning repertoire include: 1) attending, 2) imitating, and 3) discriminating. 5.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 22: Shaping Chapter Summary</head><p>Shaping is defined as the differential reinforcement of successive approximations of a desired terminal behavior. A successive approximation is a behavior that gradually changes to more closely resemble the terminal behavior until it meets criterion for that terminal behavior. During a shaping procedure, a behavior analyst reinforcers a learner's emission of behaviors that are closer to the terminal behavior than the client's previously emitted behaviors, while placing the previously emitted less closer behaviors on extinction. A behavior can be shaped along any of its measurable dimensions (e.g., form, duration, magnitude, latency, etc.). The term to describe shaping in this manner is "shaping within response topographies", as the form of the behavior remains constant and only a specific dimension of the behavior is gradually changed. Behavior can also be shaped across response topographies, where the form of behavior changes until it meets criterion for the terminal behavior.</p><p>The benefits of shaping are it teaches learners to engage in novel behaviors with the use of positive reinforcement and it typically does not involve aversive procedures. Shaping is also systematic and can easily be combined with other behavior change strategies. Shaping has a number of limitations, with the primary one being that its implementation can be time consuming. Although, the term "successive" suggests that shaping is a linear process, many times it is not. The process can be erratic and may not move forward in a smooth progression, especially when conducted with less skilled practitioners. The practitioner must continuously monitor the behavior and detect and reinforce subtle changes toward the terminal behavior. As with other behavior change procedures, individuals (often those not trained in behavior analysis) unknowingly misapply the procedure and inadvertently shape inappropriate behavior (including harmful ones).</p><p>Prior to using shaping, practitioners should consider a number of factors. Is the terminal behavior appropriate for shaping? Are appropriate resources available to successfully implement shaping? Will another behavior change procedure more adequately address the issue? Additionally, one should be familiar with the ten Modern Principle of Shaping (Prior, 1999). Since time is a concern with shaping, strategies aimed at improving its efficiency are likely to further its utility. The efficiency of shaping can be improved by combining it with verbal, model, and physical prompts. One's use of a percentile schedule might assist the practitioner in selecting and reinforcing successive approximations in a more systematic manner. This would enable a more consistent application of the procedure across practitioner skill levels and among a team of individuals using shaping with an individual learner. A popular application of shaping is called clicker training. It has been used to shape behavior across a wide array of animals, including humans. Emerging applications of shaping includes its use with computers, in robotics, and in telehealth.</p></div>

This study evaluated the efficacy and necessity of a shaping procedure to teach four children complex functional communication responses (i.e., FCR, complex mand statements) from simpler FCRs. Experiment 1 demonstrated the efficacy of the shaping procedure with two children. Experiment 2 evaluated the same shaping procedure with two different children but also included probes of the terminal response throughout. The results of both experiments indicated complex FCRs can be taught via shaping while keeping problem behavior low. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that each progressive step of the shaping procedure was necessary, as the participants did not engage in the terminal form of the FCR until all previous approximations had been mastered and the terminal response had been directly taught.</p></div>

When a trainer moves from one successive approximation to the next during a shaping procedure, the subject may not readily engage in the new successive approximation. This results in an extended period of time without the subject receiving reinforcement. In this situation, the trainer might reinforce a response that does not meet the new criterion, in an effort to increase the rate of reinforcement. This reinforcement delivery has been called a "desperation-driven click." Additional anecdotal reports suggest the subject may continue performing the behavior that was just followed by the one reinforcer presentation, even without additional reinforcement. This situation is problematic, as it can interfere with the subject's acquisition of the terminal behavior. The "desperation-driven click" situation was created with the human participants and its results have implications regarding the effect of just one accidental reinforcer delivery during the implementation of behavioral interventions, especially those that include shaping procedures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 23: Chaining Chapter Summary</head><p>A behavior chain is a specific sequence of discrete behaviors that result in one terminal outcome. Each response within the behavior chain produces a specific stimulus change that reinforces that response and each stimulus change functions as an S D for the following response. The reinforcer for the final response also functions as a reinforcer for completion of all the behaviors in the chain. Chaining is used to teach new behaviors by combining or adding to behaviors already in the learner's repertoire to create more complex behaviors. Chaining can be combined with other behavior change strategies to teach learners more skills. Further, the use of chaining to teach new skills enables learners to become more independent and live in less restrictive environments.</p><p>The components of a behavior chain are determined via a task analysis (TA), where the steps that make up a complex task are broken up into smaller, sequenced, teachable parts. A task analysis should be individualized for the specific learner. It can be constructed by observing a competent individual perform the task, completing the task yourself, or consulting with an expert. Systematic trial and error procedures may also be needed to further refine the TA. Once the TA has been finalized, the behavior analyst uses it to assess the learner's performance of each component. The four methods for teaching a behavior chain are forward chaining, backward chaining, total-task chaining, and backward chaining with leap aheads. The training method used to teach a specific task to a learner should be determined by the task and the learner's individual needs.</p><p>The term "behavior chain" is likely to bring up thoughts of favorable adaptive skills. However, individuals may also engage in maladaptive and harmful behavior chains. In addition to knowing how to teach behavior chains, behavior analyst must also be adept at disrupting or breaking undesirable behavior chains. Six strategies aimed at addressing inappropriate behavior chains include extinction, satiation, unchaining, interrupting the chain, substituting the S D , and extending the chain with time delays.</p><p>As with other behavioral procedures, troubleshooting issues with the chaining procedure might be necessary when it does not produce the desired results. One could re-examine the S D -response sequences to make sure the correct contingencies have remained in place. One may need to determine if similar S D s are evoking a different response.</p><p>The identification of both relevant and irrelevant S D s within the natural setting, ensuring there is cohesion between the S D s in the training and natural settings, and identifying and planning for the appearance of novel stimuli might also address a problematic behavior chain procedure. Additional variables that should be considered include, the accuracy of the TA, the behavior chain's complexity, the use of appropriate schedules of reinforcement, the use of sufficient variations of relevant stimuli, and the potential need for relevant response variations. All these factors may individually or in combination influence the learner's performance of a behavior chain and the efficacy of chaining procedures.</p></div>

The chapter concludes with a description of best practices for the effective use of extinction and circumstances when extinction may be contraindicated.</p><p>Extinction involves withholding reinforcement for a previously reinforced behavior, which subsequently decreases the rate of that behavior. As a behavior change tactic, extinction provides zero probability of reinforcement. As a process, extinction refers to the diminished rate of a behavior when it no longer produces reinforcement. As a principle, extinction describes the functional relation between withholding the reinforcer and the diminishing rate of a behavior. Despite it being a specific procedure, process, and principle, the term extinction is frequently misused.</p><p>Misuses that commonly occur include using the term extinction to refer to any decrease in responding, confusing extinction with forgetting, confusing response blocking with sensory extinction, and confusing non-contingent reinforcement with extinction. These errors in understanding extinction can lead to erroneous assumptions and faulty treatment decisions.</p><p>Different extinction procedures are used to address the function of the problem behavior and these procedures often produce secondary effects. Extinction of behaviors maintained by positive reinforcement occurs when the behavior no longer produces the reinforcer. Extinction of behavior maintained by negative reinforcement occurs when the behavior does not result in the removal of an aversive stimulus (escape extinction). Extinction of behavior maintained by automatic positive reinforcement occurs when the behavior does not produce the sensory consequence (sensory extinction). It is common for behaviors undergoing extinction to show predictable characteristics which can make the procedure difficult to apply. There is frequently an immediate initial increase in the rate of behavior during extinction, known as an "extinction burst", and the magnitude of the behavior may intensify as well. There can also be extinction-induced variability, where diverse and novel forms of behavior occur during the extinction process. It is common for the behavior undergoing extinction to reappear after being reduced to a pre-reinforcement level, a phenomenon known as "spontaneous recovery". A reappearance of the target behavior, referred to as "resurgence", can also occur when reinforcement for a replacement behavior is reduced or discontinued. Finally, extinction procedures can result in emotional and aggressive outbursts, such as escape rage, prolonged whining, and crying.</p><p>Continued responding during an extinction procedure is called "resistance to extinction" and is a result of the schedule of reinforcement or the strength of the reinforcer, the strength of the motivating operation, the number of previous extinction trials, or the response effort required to engage in the behavior. In general, greater resistance to extinction is seen with behaviors on intermittent, variable, or thin schedules of reinforcement, behaviors where the MO is high, behaviors with long histories of reinforcement, and behaviors requiring little effort.</p><p>To increase the effectiveness of extinction, several guidelines are recommended and include withholding the reinforcer consistently, adding instructions to the extinction procedure, combining extinction with other interventions, increasing the number of extinction trials, and involving others in the implementation of extinction. Practitioners should plan for extinction induced aggression and guard against unintentional extinction of desired behaviors. Although extinction can be effective, it is contraindicated in circumstances where the behavior is harmful, sources of reinforcement cannot be withheld, when a rapid reduction is needed, or when others are likely to imitate the problem behavior.</p></div>

What are five strategies for making extinction more successful? This article reviews the procedural variations for extinction based on behavioral function. It includes an excellent table that summarizes the ideas in the article.</p><p>At its foundation, differential reinforcement entails reinforcing one response class and withholding reinforcement for another response class. When used to reduce problem behavior, all differential reinforcement procedures consist of a) providing reinforcement for either the occurrence of a behavior other than problem behavior or a reduced rate of the problem behavior and b) withholding reinforcement for problem behavior.</p><p>Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) procedures use reinforcement to strengthen desirable alternatives to the problem behavior and withhold reinforcement for the problem behavior. DRA procedures employ concurrent schedules of reinforcement and strengthen the alternative behavior because responding is allocated based on the density of reinforcement, which favors the alternative behavior (matching law). A special case of the DRA, where the alternative behavior cannot physically be emitted simultaneously with the problem behavior, is differential reinforcement of incompatible behaviors (DRI). When using DRA/DRI procedures, the practitioner should select incompatible/alternative behaviors that are already in the learner's repertoire, require less effort than the problem behavior, and occur naturally at a rate that will provide sufficient opportunities for reinforcement. Additionally, best practices include reinforcing alternative behaviors immediately and consistently, gradually thinning the schedule of reinforcement, and combining DRA/DRI with other procedures to maximize its effectiveness.</p><p>Differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO) procedures provide reinforcement for the absence of problem behavior during or at specific times. There are interval DRO schedules of reinforcement, which require the practitioner to deliver reinforcement at the end of specific intervals if problem behavior did not occur during the interval. The intervals can be fixed (FI-DRO) or variable (VI-DRO). This is in contrast to momentary DRO schedules of reinforcement, which require the practitioner to deliver reinforcement at the end of a specific interval if problem behavior did not occur at the exact time the interval ends. These intervals can also be fixed (FM-DRO) or variable (VM-DRO). When using DRO, the practitioner should establish the initial DRO interval length short enough to ensure the learner's current level of behavior will produce frequent reinforcement. The mean baseline interresponse time (IRT) is often used to ensure an adequate rate of reinforcement. Best practices also include gradually increasing the duration of the interval over time, implementing the DRO across settings and/or times of day, and combining DRO with other procedures.</p><p>Differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) procedures are used when the goal is to decrease the overall frequency of a behavior but not eliminate it completely. There are full-session, interval, and spaced-responding DRL schedules. In full-session DRL, reinforcement is delivered when responding is equal to or falls below a predetermined criterion for the entire session. In interval DRL, the full session is divided into a series of equal intervals, and reinforcement is provided when responding is equal to or falls below a predetermined criterion for each individual interval. During spaced responding DRL schedules, reinforcement is provided for each response that is separated from the previous response by a minimum amount of time. Best practice when using DRL schedules include selecting the most useful DRL schedule for the target behavior and desired outcome, using baseline data to guide the initial selection of reinforcement requirements, and providing feedback to help learners monitor their rate of responding.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 26: Antecedent Interventions Chapter Summary</head><p>This chapter provides an overview of antecedent intervention and categorizes interventions as either contingency dependent (i.e., depends on differential consequences for a targeted or alternative behavior) or contingency independent (i.e., does not depend on differential consequences). The evidenced-based, contingency-independent interventions are then reviewed, including noncontingent reinforcement procedures, high-probability instructional sequences, and functional communication training. The chapter concludes with a discussion of three "default interventions" -antecedent exercise, enriched environments, and physical restraint.</p><p>Antecedent interventions are implemented prior to the occurrence of a targeted behavior and are independent of that behavior. A number of interventions fall under the umbrella of antecedent interventions and vary in their approach to reducing behavior. Some procedures manipulate motivating operations, others restrict engagement in the behavior by changing the environment, some train an alternative behavior, while others make the target behavior more effortful. It is important to understand the principle(s) underlying each of the various interventions in order to implement the procedures effectively.</p><p>Non-contingent reinforcement (NCR) involves presenting stimuli with known reinforcing properties on a fixed-time (FT) or variable-time (VT) schedule independent of the learner's behavior. NCR decreases problem behavior by making reinforcers that maintain the behavior available freely and frequently, which functions as an abolishing operation (AO) to reduce the motivation for the problem behavior. The effectiveness of NCR requires that the correct positive, negative, or automatic reinforcer is identified through a functional analysis. Other means of enhancing the effects of NCR include identifying an effective time-based schedule of reinforcement, thinning the schedule appropriately, establishing a terminal criterion for NCR, and combining NCR with other procedures.</p><p>A high-probability (high-p) instructional sequence involves presenting several high probability tasks the learner has complied with previously, prior to presenting a target instruction where there is a low probability of learner compliance. The reductive effects of this procedure resemble the abative effects of an AO as the procedure decreases the value of escape from requests as a reinforcer. Some behavior analysts use the term behavior momentum to describe these reductive effects. Using high-p instructional sequence effectively requires that the practitioner use potent reinforcers, acknowledges compliance, and that requests are presented in a rapid sequence.</p><p>Functional communication training (FCT) establishes an appropriate communicative behavior that is sensitive to existing motivating operations (MOs) and that competes with the problem behavior. The adaptive response is taught using a differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) procedure, in which the response results in the same reinforcer as the problem behavior, making it a functionally equivalent alternative. The effectiveness of FCT is enhanced when a dense schedule of reinforcement is used, when FCT is used as part of a treatment package, and when the schedule of reinforcement is thinned after the replacement behavior becomes a firmly established communicative response.</p><p>Antecedent exercise, enriched environments, and restraint are default antecedent interventions utilized to reduce target behaviors which do not rely on aligning the antecedent variables with the function of the behavior to be effective. Antecedent exercise procedures incorporate aerobic exercise prior to introducing a low-p task, while enriched environment strategies rely on noncontingent access to preferred reinforcers to compete with the reinforcers maintaining the problem behavior. Finally, antecedent restraint strategies, including personal, protective equipment, and self-restraint, rely on physically prohibiting the individual from engaging in the target behavior. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 27: Functional Behavior Assessment Chapter Summary</head><p>Operant behavior is learned and maintained because it reliably produces access to positive, negative, and/or automatic reinforcement. Problem behavior is no different, in that it can be said to have a "function" (e.g., to gain access to stimuli or escape stimuli). The topography, or form, of the problem behavior may be of concern, but it often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. On the other hand, identifying the conditions that control and maintain behavior can suggest variables one can alter to prevent or reduce the behavior, and therefore lead to intervention strategies likely to be effective. Assessment of the function of problem behavior is referred to as functional behavior assessment (FBA).</p><p>FBA can lead to effective interventions in several ways. It can identify antecedent variables-both motivating operations and discriminative stimuli-that can be altered to prevent problem behavior. Principally, however, it identifies reinforcers that maintain problem behavior; once these have been discovered, they can be made available contingent upon appropriate replacement behavior or they can be managed in a way that prevents problem behavior (e.g., delivered noncontingently). A positive side effect of FBA is that it can decrease reliance on increasingly intrusive, coercive, potentially unsafe, and punishment-based interventions. Decreased reliance on these "default technologies" occurs because when FBAs are conducted, reinforcement-based interventions are more likely to be implemented than are interventions that include a punishment component.</p><p>FBA methods can be classified into three types: descriptive assessment, indirect assessment, and functional (experimental) analysis. Descriptive assessment involves observation of the problem behavior in relation to events that are not arranged in a systematic manner. These are easier to conduct than functional analyses; however, caution must be exercised when interpreting information from them because they can be unreliable. Indirect functional assessment uses structured interviews, rating scales, and/or questionnaires. Again, these forms of assessment are easier to conduct than functional analyses, but they can be unreliable and only correlational in nature. Descriptive and indirect assessments are best reserved for hypothesis formulation only. Functional analysis, in contrast, involves systematically manipulating environmental events thought to maintain problem behavior, which may yield a clear demonstration of the variable(s) controlling problem behavior.</p><p>The basic strategy of conducting an FBA is to (1) gather information via indirect and descriptive assessments, (2) interpret the information from these assessments and formulate hypotheses about the purpose of problem behavior, (3) test these hypotheses using functional analysis, and (4) develop intervention options based on the function of problem behavior. Often, an intervention consists of selecting a replacement behavior that serves the same function as (i.e., is "functionally equivalent" to) the problem behavior. </p></div>

There are six basic steps for implementing a token economy: (1) selecting the tokens; (2) identifying the target behaviors and criteria for earning and losing tokens (if there is to be a response cost component) and if and how these vary at respective levels; (3) selecting the backup reinforcers; (4) establishing the ratio of exchange; (5) writing procedures for when and how tokens will be dispensed and exchanged; and (6) fieldtesting the system. Important decisions must be made for how to begin, implement, maintain, remove, and evaluate such systems.</p><p>A group contingency is a common consequence contingent upon the behavior of an individual member of a group, a part of the group, or everyone in the group. There are three major forms of group contingencies: independent, dependent, and interdependent group contingencies. There are six guidelines for implementing a group contingency:</p><p>( Chapter 29: Self-Management</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter Summary</head><p>We tend to assign causal states to events that precede behavior. When causal variables are not apparent in the immediate environment, the tendency to resort to internal causes, such as willpower or drive, is strong. However, these hypothetical constructs do little to actually help us understand the behaviors they claim to explain and instead lead to circular reasoning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Skinner (1953)</ref> was the first to apply the philosophy and theory of radical behaviorism to actions considered to be controlled by the self, and conceptualized self-control as a two-response phenomenon: the controlling response and the controlled response. A controlling response affects the variables in such a way as to change the probability of another behavior, the controlled response.</p><p>Self-management is defined as the personal application of behavior change tactics that produces a desired improvement in behavior in order to live a more effective or efficient life, break undesirable habits and acquire new ones, accomplish difficult tasks, and achieve personal goals. Self-management programs may involve limited tactics, or comprise an intervention package; they may be restricted to a limited response class or set of circumstances or they may be applied across a large number of responses or settings. As a behavior change strategy, self-management possesses numerous virtues, including its potential to: influence private events; capture subtle or rare responses that may be overlooked by external change agents; promote generalization; and serve as an efficient pivotal skill-that is, once learned, self-management skills may be adapted over time to a variety of situations and ultimately contribute to living a healthy and productive life.</p><p>The term self-control is often treated as synonymous with self-management, but despite Skinner's analysis, there are several reasons to prefer self-management. The main reason for this is that self-control has a narrower connotation as impulse control-as one possible outcome of self-management, in other words, and not as the independent variable by which it is achieved. Self-control in this sense can be conceptualized in terms of delay discounting: the more steeply someone discounts "larger, later" rewards, the more likely they are to act to produce "smaller, sooner" rewards and be characterized as lacking self-control. Much research has been conducted in which problematic behavior such as gambling and substance abuse are viewed through the lens of delay discounting. That literature includes several approaches to help individuals opt for larger, later rewards, including making a commitment response, progressively increasing the delay to the later reward, and engaging in intervening activities during the delay.</p><p>Two principal categories of self-management are antecedent tactics and self-monitoring. Examples of the former include manipulating motivating operations-that is, changing the conditions that make behavior more or less likely with respect to a given reinforcer-or directly modifying situational antecedents. Methods for modifying antecedents include posting prompts in the relevant setting, limiting behavior to a specific set of conditions, or arranging the environment to make desirable behavior more likely (e.g., performing the initial steps of a chain, such as putting the trash by the door in the evening so it will be more likely to be brought out in the morning) or to make undesirable behavior less likely (e.g., restricting the stimulus condition such as by removing matches and lighters from your home or car to make smoking less likely).</p><p>Self-monitoring-the most extensively studied and applied self-management strategy-is a procedure by which a person observes and responds to the behavior they are trying to change. Self-monitoring was originally developed as a method of clinical assessment for behaviors that were thought to only be observable by the client himself. Selfmonitoring is frequently combined with additional procedures such as goal setting, self-evaluation, and reinforcement delivered for meeting predetermined and self-determined criteria. Self-monitoring is useful across a wide range of behavior for individuals of varying ages and abilities. It is more likely to be successful if it is easy to do, supported by supplemental materials (e.g., timers), focused on the most critical dimensions of the target behavior (e.g., rate vs. count), and conducted as frequently as possible without being disruptive or counterproductive.</p><p>Self-management programs may include self-delivery of consequences. Conceptually, self-administered consequences cannot be seen simply as the application of operant reinforcement or punishment: to leave it at that, as Skinner pointed out, does not account for why an individual does not abandon the controlling (self-administration) response in favor of responding to more appetitive concurrent schedules in effect. Guidelines for employing self-Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>administered consequences include selecting small and easy-to-deliver consequences, setting criteria that are both meaningful and attainable, keeping the program simple, and eliminating alternative ("bootleg") sources of reinforcement-even if it means putting someone else in charge.</p><p>Other types of self-management tactics include self-instruction, habit reversal, systematic desensitization, and massed practice. These are not as easy to classify with respect to the four-term contingency, but have in common the fact of a person acting in some way to change their subsequent behavior.</p><p>Implementing a self-management program can have a significant impact on the target behavior. The following six steps are recommended for designing and implementing an effective self-management program: (1) specify a goal and define the behavior to be changed; (2) self-monitor the behavior; (3) create contingencies that will compete with natural contingencies; (4) go public with the commitment to change the behavior; (5) get a self-management partner; and (6) continually evaluate the program and redesign it as needed. Finally, the most fundamental principle of selfmanagement is that behavior changes behavior.</p><p>Chapter Key Terms</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">delay discounting self-control [impulse control] self-monitoring habit reversal self-evaluation systematic desensitization massed practice self-instruction self-control [Skinner's analysis] self-management</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 30: Generalization and Maintenance of Behavior Change Chapter Summary</head><p>When a learner is taught a new response, that behavior is said to have generalized if it occurs at other times or in other places without having to be retrained completely in those particular times or places, or if functionally related behaviors occur that were not trained directly occur. This chapter concentrates on three main types of generalized behavior change: response maintenance, setting/situation generalization, and response generalization. Response maintenance refers to the extent to which a learner continues to perform a behavior after a portion or all of the intervention responsible for the initial change in behavior has been removed. Setting/situation generalization is the extent to which a learner emits the target behavior in settings or situations that are different from the instructional setting, or the setting in which the behavior was originally taught. Finally, response generalization refers to the extent to which a learner emits untrained responses that are functionally equivalent to the trained response. Some learner-intervention combinations may yield large and widespread generalization across time, settings, and responses while other interventions may produce limited generalization. As a behavioral phenomenon, generalization can take undesirable forms. For instance, with respect to setting/situation generalization, overgeneralization occurs when responding comes under the control of too broad a stimulus class, and faulty stimulus control occurs when responding occurs in the presence of irrelevant stimuli. Response generalization is problematic if variations are not forms that produce reinforcement for a given task or setting, or that may produce aversive consequences (e.g., if they are unsafe).</p><p>Generalized behavior change involves systematic planning. The first step in promoting generalized behavior changes is to select target behaviors that will meet naturally existing contingencies of reinforcement. Identifying all of the desired behavior changes and all the environments in which the learner should emit the target behaviors after training is removed defines the scope of the teaching task and helps prioritize setting-response combinations and determine which responses should be taught directly.</p><p>Stokes and Baer <ref type="bibr">(1977)</ref> proposed "an implicit technology of generalization" and behavior analysts still rely on this taxonomy when they conceptualize strategies and tactics for promoting generalized behavior change. Strategies and tactics vary with respect to a number of factors, including whether they promote generalized outcomes by concentrating on stimulus features (e.g., teaching sufficient examples, programming common stimuli, teaching loosely, and incorporating negative teaching examples), teaching a variety of response topographies, or focusing primarily on response-reinforcer relations (e.g., capitalizing on behavior traps or reinforcers that are naturally available in the generalization setting, reinforcing response variability, or using intermittent schedules of reinforcement or indiscriminable contingencies). Of course, an intervention is likely to incorporate a number of these elements. Three additional tactics that can be used to mediate generalization are bringing the target behavior under the control of a contrived stimulus in the instructional setting, teaching the learner self-management skills, and teaching the learner to recruit reinforcement or assistance.</p><p>Typically, it is impractical and undesirable to continue any behavior change intervention indefinitely. Shifting from intervention to the natural environment can be accomplished by gradual and systematic withdrawal of some or all of the three distinct components of the intervention: antecedent stimuli (e.g., prompts, cues), task modifications (form and/or criteria), and consequence variables (e.g., natural vs. contrived, immediate vs. delayed, densely vs. thinly scheduled). It must also be recognized that some learners may require some level of ongoing intervention and monitoring.</p><p>Finally, the five guiding principles for promoting generalized behavior change are: 1) minimize the need for generalization as much as possible (in other words, prioritizing and teaching the setting-response combinations that are most frequently encountered and beneficial to the learner), 2) conduct generalization probes before, during, and after instruction, 3) involve significant others whenever possible, 4) promote generalized behavior change with the least intrusive and costly tactics possible, and 5) contrive intervention tactics as needed to achieve important generalized outcomes. Deciding what is "worth doing" requires behavior analysts to balance the immediate health and safety of a client with the short-and long-term effects of an intervention while resisting the temptation to engage in "situational ethics" where decisions are based solely on short-term gains. The social validity and cost-benefit ratio of a treatment are also important factors in determining whether an intervention will result in sufficient value to the consumer. Finally, defining what it means to be a "good behavior analyst" requires practitioners to not only follow the Compliance Code, but to also engage in "selfregulation" whereby ethical decisions are calibrated over time and tempered with a well-informed integration of values, contingencies, rights, and responsibilities. Following the Compliance Code is necessary but not sufficient for being an ethical practitioner.</p><p>The Compliance Code delineates ten (10) areas of professional responsibility covering seventy-one (71) elements and provides guidance in each area. Several key requirements are essential in order for behavior analysts to meet their ethical obligations. Behavior analysts must acquire the necessary skills to practice competently, become certified and sometimes licensed where appropriate, and engage in ongoing professional development to stay current in the field of behavior analysis. Ethical practice requires that behavior analysts seek and obtain informed consent from clients prior to providing services, maintain client confidentiality at all times, and protect client dignity, health, and safety in the delivery of services. Providing ethical client services also pertains to interactions on social media and in the use of other new technologies. Behavior analysts have a responsibility to advocate for clients by assessing whether behavior treatment is needed and likely to be successful and they coordinate their services with other professionals. Practitioners should avoid conflicts of interest with their clients and especially, guard against the development of multiple relationships. In general, ethical practice requires intentional effort and is most likely to occur when behavior analysts create an organizational climate where ethical practices are supported. Practicing ethically is a pro-active, life-long process that demands vigilance and self-monitoring. 13.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1. Answers should include some variation of the following response: there are three levels of understanding within science: prediction, description, and control. Each level of understanding contributes to the overall knowledge base within a given field. Description is the level of science involving the collection of facts about observed events that can be quantified, classified, &amp; examined for possible relations with other known facts. Description often suggests hypotheses or questions for additional research. Prediction is the relative probability that when one event occurs, another event will or will not occur. Prediction is Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>primarily based on repeated observation revealing relationships between various events. Prediction demonstrates correlation between events and enables preparation. Control is the highest level of scientific understanding in which functional relations can be derived. The overarching purpose/goal of science is to achieve a thorough understanding of the phenomenon under investigation by seeking to discover real truths about the phenomenon.</p><p>2. Answers will vary. Answers should include information about a functional relation such as: A functional relation is only achieved through control and involves a specific change in one event (dependent variable), that can reliably be produced by specific manipulations of another event (independent variable), and the change in the dependent variable was unlikely to be the result of other extraneous factors (confounding variables). In addition, answers should include an example of a functional relation for a human organism.  Examples will vary but each must include (a) the terms "antecedent," "behavior," and "consequence," (b) specific examples of each (e.g., teacher says, "Line up," student lines up, teacher says "Points for everyone!"), and (c) reference to the future probability of that type of response (students more likely to line up-or perhaps follow similar directions-when asked).</p><p>8. A history of reinforcement is a unique set of experiences each individual accumulates over his or her lifetime. The history of reinforcement culminates into a unique repertoire of responses that have been selected, shaped, and maintained. Individual differences in responding to current stimulus conditions can be analyzed in terms of each individual's unique history of reinforcement and repertoire. Individuals also present "varying sensitivities" to stimuli and differences in response mechanisms which should also be taken into account when discussing individual differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Ontogeny describes how selection by consequences (contingencies of reinforcement)</head><p>operates during the lifetime of an individual organism and is considered a "conceptual parallel" to Darwin's natural selection (phylogeny, innate characteristics selected by the contingencies of survival over successive generations). Examples will vary but should reflect understanding of the fact that ontogenic behaviors are operant (i.e., learned, or a function of a history of reinforcement) and phylogenic behavior is respondent/reflexive.</p><p>10. Positive and negative reinforcement are similar in that both operations increase the future probability of behavior under comparable circumstances. A difference between positive and negative reinforcement is that their effect is brought about by a different type of stimulus change: positive reinforcement involves the presenting or increasing the intensity of a consequent stimulus; negative reinforcement involves withdrawing or decreasing the intensity of a consequent stimulus. Examples should reflect the distinction between doing something that has produced positive consequences as opposed to doing it to avoid aversive consequences (e.g., writing a paper on a topic of interest-or even to get a good grade or impress someone-as opposed to writing the paper to avoid failing a class or getting a bad grade or as an alternative to, for some, the less preferred option of taking a test), 11. Positive and negative punishment are similar in that both operations result in a reduced probability of a given response class in the future, under comparable circumstances. A difference between the operations is that positive punishment involves presenting or increasing the intensity of a consequent stimulus, while negative punishment involves withdrawing or decreasing the intensity of a consequent stimulus. Examples should involve a given type of response that occurs because it has resulted in producing an aversive stimulus event in the past, or occurs to avoid the loss of preferred stimuli (e.g., not speeding because in the past it resulted in a painful accident, as opposed to not speeding because in the past it has resulted in the loss of money in the form of a fine). Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>12. A principle of behavior (e.g., positive reinforcement) is a description of a functional relationship between behavior and one or more of its controlling variables that has thorough generality across organisms, species, settings, and behaviors.</p><p>A behavior-change tactic (e.g., time-out from positive reinforcement; differential reinforcement of other behavior [DRO]) is a technologically consistent method of changing behavior that has been derived from one or more basic principles of behavior.</p><p>13. Motivating operations are events that alter the current value of stimulus changes as reinforcement or punishment. For example, an increase in sodium intake may make water more effective as reinforcement. Discriminative stimuli, in contrast, are antecedent events that signal the availability of reinforcement contingent upon a specific response. When thirsty, features of a vending machine or water cooler are discriminative for responses that have produced liquid refreshment.</p><p>14. Stimulus control refers to the differential rates of operant responding observed in the presence or absence of antecedent stimuli. In operant conditioning, the antecedent stimuli acquire the ability to control operant behavior by having been paired with certain consequences in the past. For example, carrying an umbrella is much more likely to occur when we see grey clouds or hear a forecast for inclement weather than when the sun is shining or the weather report calls for blue skies. 3. Reactivity refers to the effects of an assessment procedure on the behavior being assessed. It is more likely to occur when observations are obtrusive, and the person is aware of the observation. The presence of the observer in the setting is a potential source of reactivity.</p><p>Unobtrusive observation procedures reduce the likelihood of reactivity. Behavior analysts should use observation methods that are as unobtrusive as possible. Repeating observations reduces the effects of reactivity. Effects of reactivity should be considered when interpreting data.</p><p>4. Habilitation is the degree to which a client's repertoire maximizes shortand long-term reinforcers and minimizes short-and long-term punishers for both the person and others.</p><p>Behavior analysts can use this principle to guide the selection of target behavior by prioritizing behavior that will increase a client's access to reinforcers and decrease their exposure to punishers. The behavior analyst must try to identify behavior that will be the most useful to the client.</p><p>5. Normalization refers to the use of progressively more typical environments, expectations, and procedures to develop behavior in clients that is as close to the cultural norm as possible.</p><p>It is a philosophy rather than a specific technique. Normalization impacts how behavior analysts select behavior and interventions. Age and setting appropriate behavior and interventions should be selected and outcomes should focus on the normalization of the client's experience in relation to their community. This may result in different behavior or interventions being selected than would be chosen in a clinical environment.</p><p>6. Ethical considerations for the behavior analyst include whether they have the right to intervene, the individual or a surrogate has the authority to grant permission for assessment and intervention, that permission has been granted, the target behavior is socially valid, and the client's functional needs will be met through intervention. The effects of the intervention on the client and stakeholders should also be considered.</p><p>7. Observable and measurable terms are beneficial because they promote agreement among practitioners and stakeholders regarding the target behavior, the nature of the intervention, the replacement behavior, and the environmental variables related to the behavior. This agreement promotes greater understanding and can build consensus in relation to identifying target behaviors, determining outcomes, and evaluating progress towards those outcomes.</p><p>8. If a problem behavior is to be eliminated or reduced, the practitioner must identify an adaptive replacement behavior and develop contingencies in the intervention plan to ensure the new behavior is learned. This is important because problem behavior serves a function for the client and to eliminate the behavior without replacing it means that access to reinforcement or escape from punishers will be denied. </p></div>

Answer should include: Whole-interval recording divides the observation into a series of equal time intervals and at the end of each interval, the target behavior is recorded if it occurred throughout the entire interval. Partial-interval recording divides the observation period into a series of equal time intervals and at the end of each interval the behavior is recorded if it occurred at any point during the interval.</p><p>5. Answer should include: Comparing the relative efficiency of two or more treatments or instructional methods, assessing learner competence in acquiring a set of concepts, or as a dependent measure of a specific skill.</p><p>6. Answer should include: Topography, which refers to the physical form or shape of a behavior, and magnitude, which refers to the force or intensity with which a response is emitted.</p><p>7. Answer should include: Duration is appropriate for behavior which occurs continuously over extended periods of time (e.g., play). It is also appropriate if the goal of intervention is to increase or decrease the length of time a target behavior occurs.</p><p>8. Answer should include: The procedures were developed because it is not possible or feasible to observe behavior continuously and therefore frequent, brief intervals for observation are more manageable. 9. Answer should include: The main advantage of momentary time sampling procedures is that the observer does not have to attend to the participant(s) or behavior continuously as they must with other measurement systems. They are only required to attend for a brief, specific moment in time.</p><p>10. Answer should include: The variability in data that exists because of the way that it is measured and examined. All time sampling procedures provide an estimate of the actual occurrence of behavior. The procedure used will affect the data collected.</p><p>11. Answer should include: Measurement by permanent product measures the impact of a behavior on the environment by examining a durable product that remains after the behavior is finished. It is not a specific procedure but refers to the time that the behavior is measured (i.e., after instead of during). Permanent products can be natural, like completed worksheets, or contrived, like video tape. Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>12. Answer should include: The behavior change goals and expected direction of behavior change, the relative ease of detecting occurrences of the behavior, the environments where and times when the behavior will be measured, and the availability and skills of personnel who will observe and record the behavior Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Valid measurement requires the following elements: measuring socially significant target behaviors directly, measuring a dimensions of the target behavior relevant to the question or concern about the behavior, and ensuring that the data are representative of the behavior's occurrence under conditions and during times that are most relevant to the question or concern about behavior. Validity is compromised when any of these elements are suspect.</p><p>2. Three threats to measurement validity in Applied Behavior Analysis include the following: when measurement is indirect, when the wrong dimension of the target behavior is measured, and/or when measurement is conducted in such a way that the data it produces are an artifact of actual events.</p><p>3. Three common causes of measurement artifacts include: discontinuous measurement, poorly scheduled measurement periods, and using insensitive or limiting measurement scales. 5. Ways to reduce the negative effects of a complex measurement system include decreasing the number of simultaneously observed individuals or behaviors, decreasing the duration of observation sessions, and increasing the duration of time intervals. Consider requiring additional practice during observer training, establish a high criterion for mastery of the observational code, and provide frequent feedback to observers.</p><p>6. Observer skills include learning the following: definitions for each response class or event to be measured, a code or symbol for each variable, a common set of recording procedures, and a method for correcting mistakes.</p><p>7. Observer drift usually entails a shift in the observer's interpretation of the definition of the target behavior from that used in training. The drift causes unintended changes in the way data are collected and may produce measurement error. Observer reactivity may also cause measurement errors; however, these errors are the result of the observer's awareness that others are evaluating the data.</p><p>8. Four purposes for conducting accuracy assessments include: 1) to determine early on in an analysis whether the data are good enough to serve as the basis for making experimental or treatment decisions; 2) to enable the discovery and correction of specific instances of measurement error; 3) to reveal consistent patterns of measurement error, which should lead to the overall improvement of the measurement system; and 4) to assure consumers that the data are accurate. Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>9. Calibrating measurement instruments entails comparing the data obtained by the measurement tool against a true value. It is important to calibrate a measurement instrument, a human or mechanical device, so that measures are more accurate. Calibration of timing devices such as a stopwatch or countdown timer could be made against a known standard such as the "atomic clock."</p><p>10. Four benefits for calculating interobserver agreement (IOA): 1) IOA may be used as a basis for determining the competence of new observers, 2) IOA over the course of an experiment can assist in the detection of observer drift, 3) A high level of interobserver agreement increases the confidence that the definition of the target behavior was clear and unambiguous and the measurement system not too difficult, 4) Consistently high levels of IOA across multiple observers increases the confidence that variability in the data is not a function of which observers are collecting data 11. In research, interobserver agreement should be assessed during each condition and phase of a study and be distributed across days of the week, times of day, settings, and observers.</p><p>12. Researchers should obtain and report IOA for all measures of each dependent variable, during each condition of a study.</p><p>13. More stringent and conservative methods of calculating IOA should be used over methods that are likely to overestimate actual agreement as a result of chance. In addition, the degree of behavior change revealed by the data should also be considered when determining an acceptable level of IOA. The benefits of graphic displays over other displays of behavioral data include: provides practitioner with immediate access to ongoing and dynamic behavior change; allows for the exploration of interesting variations in behavior; provides a device to aid in the interpretation of behavior change; provides a conservative method for determining the significance of behavior change; encourages and enables independent judgments about behavior change; and serves as an effective source of feedback in personal behavior management plans.</p><p>5. The fundamental properties common to all behavioral data include level, trend, and variability.</p><p>6. Strengths of using bar graphs include: quick and easy comparison of performance across participants or conditions; useful for displaying and comparing discrete sets of data that are not related to one another by a common underlying dimension by which the horizontal axis can be scaled; and provides visual summary of different conditions of an experiment (e.g., baseline/intervention for a group of participants).</p><p>Limitations of using bar graphs include: does not have distinct data points representing successive response measures through time; and unable to discuss variability or trends in data paths.</p><p>7. Cumulative graphs are preferable when the total number of responses made over time is important, when progress toward a specific goal can be measured in cumulative units of behavior, when the graph is used as a source of feedback for the participant, and when the target behavior can occur or not occur only once per observation session.</p><p>8. It is important for behavior analysts to maintain direct and continual contact with the behavior under investigation because behavior is a dynamic and on-going process. Changes in the behavior under investigation/targeted for change forms the empirical basis for important decision making, for example, whether to continue with the current procedure, to try a different intervention, or to reinstitute a previous condition.</p><p>9. The answer may include: six x10 cycles on vertical axis, response rates ranging from .000695 per minute to 1,000 per minute can be charted, time on horizonal axis, and consistent display of celeration. 2. FALSE. Subjectivity is not warranted; a needed level of objectivity will result from collecting baseline data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chapter 7 Answer Key</head><note type="other">Multiple</note><p>3. FALSE. For example, an ineffective intervention will yield no change from baseline, thus no opportunity for a functional relationship exists.  1. An analysis of behavior involves identifying a relation between an environmental variable (or intervention package) that is reliably associated with control over the behavior-i.e., a functional relation. As such, this variable or intervention package can serve as a reliable treatment. This differs from a complete analysis (or understanding) of the behavior because it doesn't explain all variables that could account for it. Just because you've identified one effective intervention doesn't mean that there aren't others (i.e., other sets of variables that yield the same reliable control).</p><p>2. Description-Systematic observation yields a collection of objective facts about observed events. Personal bias is controlled. Prediction-Objective measurement results in the discovery that two or more events consistently covary. This relation may or may not be causal. Experimental control-Highest level of understanding, achieved when a predictable change in behavior can be reliably produced by the systematic manipulation of some aspect of the person's environment. In other words, it is demonstrated that the independent variable caused the measurable change in the dependent variable.</p><p>3. Replication is necessary to provide convincing evidence that the independent variable reliably controls the dependent variable. With replication, the probability of the behavior change coinciding with the onset and offset of the intervention being the result of another variable is drastically reduced; thus lending credibility to the influence of the independent variable over the dependent variable.</p><p>4. Answers should include the lawfulness of behavior and the fact that it is a natural phenomenon.</p><p>5. Masking variability hides the factors that influence behavior. Sometimes these influences can be significant and even more interesting than the intervention being studied. For instance, variability evident in daily graphs of tantrums may be averaged over months with the result of drastically reducing variability. However, it may also mask the fact that events occurring on a monthly cycle are exerting control over behavior. Such events may include a monthly paycheck, menses, regular monthly outings, etc. Identification of these events, evident on a daily graph, would lead to alternative intervention strategies.</p><p>6. Variability indicates a lack of control-and therefore understanding-with respect to the factors that influence the behavior of interest. Behavior analysts attempt to identify the determinants of variability and eliminate or control them. responding is a prerequisite to comparing a subsequent intervention condition. Without first achieving steady state responding, one could not predict the level of future responding absent an intervention; hence, one could not predict or even convincingly demonstrate the impact of the intervention. 9. The data suggest a possible relation between the intervention and the change in behavior. However, because there are possibly other changes that coincided with the onset of the intervention, we cannot yet assert a functional relation; to make such a claim would require replications with the same effect in the context of an experimental design. with the onset of an intervention and this effect is reversed with the offset of the intervention and then changes again with a second onset, then evidence is provided of a functional relation between the intervention and the change in behavior. B. In a multielement design, the rapid alternation of treatments, along with different SDs under the two (or more) treatment conditions and other counterbalancing measures (e.g., time of day) ensures that any differential responding that occurs under the various conditions will be the result of those conditions. This is made evident by a graphical display of responding under one condition (graphed as one data series) being consistently higher than responding under another condition (graphed as a different data series). 4. Describe an appropriate research design for each of the following scenarios.</p><p>A. The dependent variable would be study behavior and the independent variable would be contingent vs. noncontingent praise. A reversal design employing a noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) reversal technique would most likely be used. B. The dependent variable would be quiz scores and the independent variable would be Procedures X and Y. A multielement design would be appropriate here. C. The dependent variable would be disruptive behavior and the independent variable would be response cost. An A-B-A-B (or reversal) design would be appropriate in this instance. 2. FALSE. The possibility of co-variation between different behaviors is a limitation of a multiple baseline design.</p><p>3. TRUE.</p><p>4. FALSE. The fact that the behavior must already be in the participant's repertoire is a limitation of the changing criterion design. 3. Answer should include: One condition that multiple probe design is effective for is evaluating the effects of instruction on skill sequences in which it is highly unlikely that the participant's performance on later steps of the sequence could improve without instruction or mastery of earlier steps. A second condition is when prolonged baseline measurement may prove reactive, impractical, or too costly.</p><p>4. Answer should include: Limitations include (a) having to wait too long to modify certain behaviors, (b) a tendency for baseline phases to contain too few data points and (c) the fact that baselines begun after the independent variable has been applied to earlier baselines can mask the interdependence of behaviors.</p><p>5. Answer should include: Two or more different behaviors for one participant are selected and baseline measurement for each behavior is conducted. After steady state responding is obtained in baseline, the independent variable is applied to one behavior while maintaining baseline conditions for the other(s). When steady state or criterion-level performance is reached for the first behavior, the independent variable is applied to the next behavior.</p><p>6. Answer should include: A multiple probe design is used to analyze the relationship between an independent variable and the acquisition of a successive approximation or a sequence of behaviors. Intermittent measures, or probes, are taken on all behaviors at the beginning of the experiment. Probes are then taken each time the participant has achieved mastery of one of the behaviors or skills in the sequence. Just prior to instruction on each behavior, a true baseline measure is taken until stability is achieved.</p><p>7. Answer should include: Baselines begun after the independent variable has been applied to previous behaviors, settings, or subjects cannot be used to verify predictions based on earlier tiers of the design. Only baselines begun while the earlier behavior is still under baseline conditions can be used to verify predictions made for earlier behaviors.</p><p>8. Answer should include: Three situations are when a planned reversal is not desired or possible, limited resources preclude a full-scale multiple baseline design, and a new behavior, setting, or subject appropriate for a multiple baseline analysis becomes available. 9. Answer should include: the length of the phases, the magnitude of the criterion changes, and the number of criterion changes.</p><p>10. Answer should include: The first problem is that large changes may not permit the inclusion of a sufficient number of changes in the design because the terminal level of performance is reached sooner. The second problem is that criterion changes cannot be so large that they contradict good instructional practices. The changes must be detectable but also achievable. is used to cancel out variability. Causes of variability are attributed to chance and are not eradicated through statistical treatments.</p><p>3. Answer should include: First, the majority of studies that have advanced the field of applied behavior analysis have used experimental designs that incorporated one or more of those tactics. Second, examination of isolated experimental tactics is one step in learning the assumptions and principles that guide selection and arrangement of those tactics into an effective experimental design to answer a specific research question.</p><p>4. Answer should include: Treatment drift occurs when the application of the independent variable during later stages of the experiment differs from the way the treatment was applied at the outset of the study. Treatment drift is a threat to the internal validity of a study. Low treatment integrity is a major source of confound in an experiment, making it difficult, or impossible, to interpret the results with confidence. 2) TRUE.</p><p>3) FALSE. Reinforcement should be delivered immediately upon the display of the target behavior. Waiting even 30 s can result in the reinforcer following some other behavior and not achieving the desired result. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1) Answers will vary. In the circular argument, the two variables should both be effects and unable to be separated from one another so that one could be manipulated to test the effect on the other. In the non-circular argument, one variable should be one that can be manipulated in order to observe the effect on the other. The explanation for why one argument is circular, and the other is not should revolve around these concepts.</p><p>2) Answers will vary but should include an MO, an S D , a target behavior, and a SR + . There should be an indication that future responding increases as well. The MO should be relevant to the SR + selected (e.g., if food is the reinforcer, the MO should involve food deprivation).</p><p>3) This statement is self-contradictory because if a "reinforcement program" didn't "work" (i.e., the target behavior did not increase), then the program wasn't a reinforcement program.</p><p>Reinforcement is defined by its effect on the target behavior. If the target behavior did not increase, the target behavior was not reinforced.</p><p>4) Reinforcement is arbitrary in the sense that any behavior that is followed closely in time by a reinforcer gets reinforced. It does not matter if the behavior is desirable or not, or whether the delivery of reinforcement was programmed or not. Behaviors are selected (i.e., they continue to occur as functional behaviors) because they produce reinforcement.</p><p>5) Automatic reinforcement means that a behavior produces its own reinforcement. Another person does not have to deliver it. An example is scratching your skin. The act of scratching produces stimulation that may be reinforcing to an individual.</p><p>6) This statement is false because a conditioned reinforcer is effective across a wide range of MO conditions. Many reinforcers function to reinforce a wide range of behaviors. However, a generalized reinforcer does not depend upon a specific MO to be effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7)</head><p>A reinforcer assessment is a direct, data-based method of presenting one stimulus contingent upon a behavior and measuring the extent to which that behavior increases over time. A reinforcer assessment verifies if a stimulus functions as a reinforcer. A preference assessment measures preference for stimuli but does not verify whether these stimuli are actual reinforcers.</p><p>8) All these reinforcer assessment methods involve evaluating whether the stimulus maintains responding and, therefore, serves as a reinforcer. They also all involve using different schedules of reinforcement. With a concurrent schedule of reinforcement, two schedules of reinforcement are in place at the same time. 5. Positive and negative reinforcement are similar in that they both produce increases in future target behavior. Positive and negative reinforcement are different in that positive reinforcement involves the presentation of a desired stimulus following a target behavior, whereas negative reinforcement involves the termination of an aversive stimulus following a target behavior.</p><p>6. Negative reinforcement and punishment are similar in that they both involve aversive stimuli. However, with negative reinforcement, the aversive stimulus is present prior to the occurrence of the target behavior. With punishment, the aversive stimulus follows the occurrence of problem behavior. Negative reinforcement produces an increase in the future occurrence of the target behavior. Punishment produces a decrease in the future occurrence of the target behavior.</p><p>7. Answers will vary but should include all elements of the discriminated avoidance or escape contingency.</p><p>8. Examples will vary but answers should include: Ethical concerns regarding the use of negative reinforcement also exist for positive reinforcement. With both procedures, an effective EO must be in place to evoke the target response. That EO is often the presence of an aversive condition. The EO for positive reinforcement involves a state of deprivation that makes the reinforcer for engagement in the target behavior valuable. With negative reinforcement, the EO involves the presence of an aversive stimulus to evoke the target behavior that results in the offset of the stimulus. 9. Answers will vary but should include examples that meet the following definitions. Unconditioned negative reinforcers are related to our inherited capacity to respond to them (e.g., painful stimuli). Conditioned negative reinforcers are originally neutral events that acquired their effects through pairing with existing negative reinforcers. 2. A scallop effect often occurs with fixed interval schedules of reinforcement. Because the end of the interval is predictable, there is often little responding early in the interval. However, as the end of the interval nears, responding tends to increase to higher rates, peaking at the end of the interval. Following the end of the interval, responding again decreases to low levels until the end of the interval approaches again. On a cumulative graph, this results in a visual pattern that resembles a scallop.</p><p>Examples will vary but should be consistent with the definitions of fixed and variable ratio schedules. (Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcement require that a certain, constant number of responses occur before a reinforcer is delivered. A variable ratio schedule of reinforcement is similar, except that the number of responses that must occur before a reinforcer is delivered varies around a mean number.) Ratio strain is demonstrated when the ratio of required responses to reinforcement is changed quickly. The effect is that responding decreases. Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc.

Punishment will be more effective when the problem behavior is contacting little to no reinforcement. A functional analysis enables the practitioner to identify the reinforcers for problem behavior. Once identified, one can attempt to break the problem behavior reinforcer contingency. A functional analysis also enables the practitioner to find a replacement behavior that serves the same function as the problem behavior. Punishment is likely to be more effective when combined with reinforcement for an appropriate alternative behavior.</p><p>4. Answers should include: Positive practice and restitutional overcorrection are both positive punishment procedures that involve the learner engaging in an alternative behavior that is essentially the opposite of the problem behavior. Positive practice involves the learner repeating a correct form of the behavior or a behavior that is incompatible with the problem behavior a specified number of times contingent on the learner's engagement in problem behavior. With restitutional overcorrection, the learner repairs the damage they caused or returns the environment to its original state and then engages in additional behavior to bring the environment to a condition that is better than it was prior to their engagement in problem behavior. 2.

Answers should include: Advantages of a time-out room include: 1) the individual has substantially less opportunities to acquire reinforcement in a time-out room; 2) the individual quickly learns to discriminate the time-out room from the time-in area, resulting in the timeout room acquiring conditioned aversive properties. This in turn, makes the time-in areas even more reinforcing; and 3) the individual is less likely to get hurt or hurt others when removed from time-in to the time-out room. Disadvantages include: 1) the individual may resist or engage in emotional outburst while being escorted to time-out. The implementer should be prepared to address these behaviors; 2) using a time-out room could function as a negative reinforcer for the implementer resulting in its increased use; 3) the time-out room could become an S D for the individual's engagement in destructive or inappropriate selfstimulatory behavior; and 4) the public is likely to have negative perceptions about the use of a time-out room.</p><p>4.

That is, they temporarily evoke or increase a dimension of the behavior associated with the punisher.</p><p>2. Answers should include: Behavior altering effects are temporary evocative or abative stimulus effects that change the current frequency of behavior. Antecedent stimuli have behavior altering effects. Function altering effects are repertoire altering stimulus effects that allow an individual to behave differently in the future. The contingent presentation of a stimulus (i.e., a consequence) has a function altering effect. The same antecedent events that function as MOs are likely to have function altering effects that change the future frequency of behavior when applied as consequences.</p><p>3. Answers should include definitions of each CMO. Examples will vary. CMO-S: The surrogate CMO is a previously neutral stimulus that was paired with an UMO to acquire its MO effects. CMO-R: The reflexive CMO is an antecedent stimulus that is associated with the worsening of a condition. Its own offset functions as a negative reinforcer. CMO-T: The transitive CMO is a stimulus that makes another stimulus a valuable reinforcer or punisher. 1. FALSE. Operant and respondent stimulus control are not identical. While both involve antecedent stimuli evoking a response, there is a difference between the function of the discriminative stimulus for operant behavior and the conditioned stimulus for respondent conditioning.

Motivating operations and discriminative stimuli are similar in the following ways: (1) they both occur before the behavior of interest, and (2) both events have evocative functions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1. Two general methods for controlling value changes in the MO include capturing the MO value change as it occurs naturally and creating the MO by generating some change that alters the value of the consequence. To capture a naturally occurring MO, the practitioner would look for changes in collateral behaviors that may be evoked by the MO (such as looking at an iPad that is on the shelf). Creating motivation requires the practitioner to make a direct change in the environment (e.g., introducing an iPad). Examples will vary.</p><p>2. Definition of autoclitic relation: a speaker's own verbal behavior functions as an S D or an MO for additional speaker verbal behavior. This is a secondary verbal behavior about a speaker's own verbal behavior. Examples will vary but can include an autoclitic mand (e.g., "Believe me; that is the correct answer"), tact ("I am confident that this is the way") or intraverbal autoclitic frame ("May I have a ___ ?"). 2. Three ways in which private events interfere with well-being are by (1) evoking unpleasant emotional responses that monopolize attention (e.g., anxiety leads to avoidance or to dwelling more on private stimuli-thoughts and feelings-than on the current external activities and environment), (2) contributing to the spread of suffering via transformation of functions (e.g., receiving praise and being unable to resist conceiving of its opposite), and (3) excessive rule-governance, which can take place in the absence of support from the external environmental, including things in the local environment that could displace or contradict it. Examples will vary.</p><p>3. Examples will vary but may include unpleasant thoughts or emotions such as depression, anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and may include-but don't necessarily need to include, overt manifestation of these. The two tactics are altering the aversive function of private events and lessening the control of private events over other behavior. These are actually named in multiple choice question 10, above, but the present question requires elaboration both in terms of an example and reference to the behavioral mechanism of the tactic. Altering the aversive function may be effective in a way that is analogous to exposure therapy: repeated contact with the aversive stimulus in the absence of negative consequences diminishes its power to evoke or elicit the undesirable response (this could be an extinction phenomenon, but it may be unfair to expect students to state that and it is not mentioned in the chapter).</p><p>Lessening the control of private events over other behavior does not involve confronting the aversive condition but rather simply acknowledging it while "mindfully" focusing on nonaversive stimuli in the immediate environment, the practice of which should be automatically negatively reinforcing. self-management; and a commitment to research. The methods, in contrast, are very different: ACT methods do not target discrete observable target behavior; systematically manipulate externally arranged consequences; and may not even set out to teach specific replacement behavior. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Singh et al. (2011)</ref> study on reducing aggression by 3 adolescents with autism may be instructive with respect to an example: a conventional approach would have completed a functional assessment or analysis and likely taught some form of replacement behavior, such as an individualized functional communicative response based on the analysis; the emphasis would be on managing the situations that typically evoked aggression. The approach in the study, on the other hand, was to teach each boy to first manage the emotional response, regardless of function, with the use of a breathing and bodyfocused exercise intended to delay impulsive and unsafe action and defuse the emotion historically associated with those unsafe actions. In either event, incidentally, the intervention could lead via different paths to comparable reinforcement, in some measure: escape or avoidance of unpleasant feelings and outcomes, and contact with positive reinforcement that aggression would have precluded.

If a person does the same action as a model, and the behavior comes into contact with reinforcement, then the behavior becomes a discriminated operant. If the person then displays this behavior in the presence of another model, it is not considered imitation, but a discriminated operant. If a model is displayed that is novel (meaning the individual has never observed this behavior before and has no history of reinforcement with that behavior), and a person then displays the same behavior, we can say imitation has occurred. The text describes at least two examples that illustrate this. First, if a guitarist hears a novel section of improvised music and then immediately reproduces it, imitation has occurred. However, if one guitarist says to another, "Listen to this. I want to teach you this." The first guitarist demonstrates the new section of music. They practice until the second guitarist learns it. On stage the first guitarist plays the section of new music, and the second guitarist immediately follows by reproducing the same music, imitation has not occurred. Rather the second guitarist's reproduction is the result of a discriminated operant (as a result of the reinforcement history).</p><p>3. The five elements are: 1. Assessing and teaching prerequisite skill for imitation training if necessary. This is important because learners cannot learn if they do not attend to the presentation of the model. Therefore, it is often necessary to teach prerequisite skills, such as, staying seated, looking at the teacher, keeping hands in lap, and looking at objects prior to beginning imitation training. 2. Selecting models for training. At least 25 behaviors to use as models should be selected in order to make generalized imitation more likely. These should range from gross to fine motor movements. 3. Pretesting. The pretest may show that the learner imitates some models without training.</p><p>One should pretest all models at least 3 times. If the learner can perform certain models a specified number of times, then the practitioner should advance to the next level of training. 4. Sequencing models for training. Practitioners should use pretest results to sequence the models for training, arranging them from easiest to most difficult. "Easiest" models are those that the learner performed correctly at least sometimes during pretesting, and "most difficult" models are those that the learner never performed correctly during pretesting.</p></div>

Imitation training consists of four conditions:</head><p>preassessment (where a short pretest is given before each training session); training (during which practitioners provide repeated presentations of a model and reinforces approximations and/or uses prompts to get the imitation to occur); post assessment (during which the practitioner presents 5 previously learned models and 3 newly learned models to assess learning); and probes for imitative behaviors (where the practitioner will use 5 nontrained, novel models to probe for occurrences of imitation). 2.

One might want to interrupt a behavior chain that is inappropriate or maladaptive. When interrupting a behavior chain, identify the point in the chain at which the interruption will occur. Begin the task. When the learner has reached the predetermined interruption point, restrict/block the learner's ability to complete the step and prompt the desired response. After the interruption, the learner completes the remainder of the task. 7. Answers should include the following. 1) Completeness of task analysis: Missing elements of a task analysis will make the behavior chain more difficult to learn. The more accurate and complete the TA, the easier it will be for the learner to proceed through the chain. 2) Length or complexity of the chain: The longer and more complex the chain, the more difficult it will be to learn. 3) Schedule of reinforcement: The use of a schedule of reinforcement that is appropriate for the behavior chain will maintain responding in the chain. Consider the number of responses making up the chain when determining the type of chaining procedure to use and the schedule of reinforcement. For example, with backward chaining, responses at the end of the chain are closer to the reinforcer and get reinforced more often. With forward chaining, responses at the front of the chain are reinforced more often but are further from the terminal reinforcer. 4) Stimulus variation: If an S D is likely to vary, the learner may respond incorrectly to the untrained variations. Introduce all variations of an S D when teaching a behavior chain. This will ensure the learner responds accurately regardless of the presented variation. 5) Response variation: A variation in the S D is likely to require a varied response to produce the same result in the behavior chain. When stimulus variations are present, the instructor must teach the relevant response associated with the S D .</p></div>

Extinction of a behavior maintained by positive reinforcement would consist of withholding the reinforcer previously maintaining the problem behavior, contingent upon the occurrence of problem behavior. For example, if a problem behavior was maintained by access to adult attention, extinction would involve the adult not providing attention contingent upon the occurrence of the identified behavior. On the other hand, for a behavior maintained by negative reinforcement, extinction would involve no longer providing escape from the aversive stimulus; rather, the individual would be required to continue interacting with the aversive stimulus following the problem behavior. For example, if the problem behavior was maintained by escape from toothbrushing, extinction would involve not letting the individual discontinue toothbrushing when the behavior occurred. Instead the individual would be required to continue with the toothbrushing task. Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>2.

A DRO interval should be based on the baseline rate of responding. The best way to determine the interval is to compute the average baseline interresponse time and set your DRO interval slightly below this number in order to make it more likely that the learner will contact the contingencies of reinforcement that are in place. This interval length can be increased gradually over time.</p><p>4. A DRO interval can be increased by a constant duration of time (e.g., 15 seconds each time), proportionately (e.g., by 10% each time), or based on the learner's performance (e.g., using the IRT from the last session).</p><p>5. Answers should include: a) Full-session DRL involves delivering reinforcement at the end of an instructional session if the target behavior was below a predetermined criterion for the entire session. ✓ Examples will vary: For example, if the target behavior is pencil sharpening, then the learner would need to sharpen pencils only X times throughout the entire class period in order to receive the reinforcer. b) In interval DRL, the instructional session is divided into a series of smaller intervals, and the learner receives reinforcement if the behavior does not exceed the predetermined criterion for each interval. ✓ Examples will vary: For example, the teacher could divide a class period into two intervals, and the learner could earn reinforcement for each interval during which pencils were sharpened fewer than X times.</p><p>6. A spaced-responding DRL contingency is most useful when the practitioner wants a behavior to occur with a specific IRT. That is, a spaced-responding DRL involves delivering a reinforcer following an occurrence of a behavior that is separated by at least a minimum amount of time from a previous behavior. This would be useful anytime a certain "pace" of behavior is important. One example might be using the bathroom. This behavior is expected to occur at certain intervals during the day. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1. Noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) is an antecedent intervention in which stimuli with known reinforcing properties are delivered on a fixed-time (FT) or variable-time (VT) schedule independent of the learner's behavior. NCR may effectively decrease problem behavior because reinforcers that maintain the problem behavior are available freely and frequently. NCR functions as an abolishing operation (AO) but some behavior analysts use "behavior momentum" to describe the effects of this procedure. NCR uses positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and automatic reinforcement. When using NCR there are three key elements for implementing it effectively.

High-p sequence is an antecedent intervention that is also known as a high-probability instructional sequence. A high-p sequence involves the presentation of a series of easy-tofollow requests for which the individual has a history of compliance (i.e. high-p requests).</p><p>After the individual complies with several high-p requests, the target request is presented (i.e. low-p). Behavioral effects of high-p instructional sequence suggest the abative effects of an abolishing operation by reducing the value of reinforcement for non-compliance to low-p requests. The high-p sequence provides non-aversive procedure for improving compliance by diminishing escape-maintained problem behaviors. This technique may decrease excessive slowness in responding to requests and increase the time used for completing tasks.</p><p>Considerations for using the high-p instructional sequence effectively include selecting behaviors from the current repertoire, presenting requests in rapid succession, acknowledging compliance, and using potent reinforcers.  A functional behavior assessment allows a practitioner to obtain information about the purpose (or function) of a behavior for an individual.

The answer should include points such as an FBA 1) develops an understanding of the function of a behavior, 2) can suggest various types of interventions to prevent and replace problem behavior, and 3) may assist in prevention efforts by identifying the conditions that pose risks for future development of problem behaviors.</p></div>

Answers should also include an illustration of the limitations such as: 1) assessment process may temporarily strengthen or increase the undesirable behavior to unacceptable levels, or result in the behavior acquiring new functions, which pose ethical and safety concerns; 2) the arrangement of conditions that set the occasion for, or potentially reinforce, problem behavior can be counter intuitive to causal observers; 3) some behaviors may not be amenable to a functional analysis because they occur infrequently; 4) if conducted in a contrived setting it might not detect the variable that accounts for the occurrence of the problem behavior in the natural routine; and 5) the time, effort, and professional expertise required to conduct and interpret functional analyses can be an obstacle to its use in practice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1. In a level system, students must acquire and achieve increasingly more refined behavior repertoires while the frequency of token reinforcement, social praise, or other desirable reinforcers is simultaneously decreased. As students advance through the levels, they earn more privileges, but their behavioral expectations also increase.</p><p>2. When a student doesn't earn tokens and becomes upset, it is important for the behavior analyst to remain calm and neutral. Avoid getting into confrontations, power struggles, and arguments over tokens. It is of course necessary that the student possesses the skills to earn tokens; if that is the case, then complaints should be handled with a matter-of-fact response such as, "You can try again tomorrow. " Similarly, when an individual tests the system, the behavior analyst should remain calm and neutral, responding with comments like, "That's your choice, " rather than getting into a verbal exchange/debate over the matter. It is important to consider buy-in: students should have the opportunity to contribute to facets of the system, such the development of rules and criteria or the selection and management of rewards.</p><p>3. Three things to consider when using a response cost system as part of a token economy are:</p><p>(1) any behaviors subject to response cost should be clearly defined and stated in the rules, (2) more serious inappropriate behavior should result in greater token losses, and (3) a student should never lose more tokens than he/she possess (avoid having learners go "into debt").</p><p>4. Management issues to consider are: a. Students need to be taught how to manage their tokens so that they are out of the way but readily available when needed. Students need to be taught how to store them safely so that they are not stolen. b. Preemptive measures should be taken to avoid counterfeiting and bootlegging. Select tokens that are not easily duplicated. c. Some students may hoard tokens and never exchange them, while others may exchange too freely and be unable to save for high quality items. Encourage spending for hoarders, and do not allow students with fewer than the requisite number of tokens to exchange (i.e., do not make "loans"). d. Chronic rule breakers deserve special consideration. It may be necessary to evaluate the quality of the reinforcers. It may be necessary to use a different system with them. 7. Answers will vary.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1. Good behavior analysts are self-regulating. This means they continually seek ways to calibrate their behavior and decisions to ensure that values, contingencies, rights, and responsibilities are integrated and an informed combination of these is considered in delivering behavior analytic services.

While improvement in on-task behavior was comparable across the two interventions, self-monitoring of attention produced substantially higher gains in spelling study behavior among 4 of the 6 students. This is the first study in which differential effects of these 2 interventions was investigated among students with ADHD; previous studies of students with learning disabilities (LD) found that self-monitoring of performance tended to result in higher rates of spelling study than did self-monitoring of attention.Lee, S.-H., Simpson, R.

This is an example of is helping his son memorize a poem for class. The son must first correctly recite the first line from memory in order to receive his father's praise. Once the son can recite the first line without error, the father tells him to add on the next line of the poem. This process continues until the son can recite the entire poem by heart. This is an example of Mavis has been working with a child to shape his handwriting. When Mavis started working with the child, he could hold his pencil and write the letters of his name, but the marks were so faint that one could hardly see them.

Standardized tests are administered in a specific way with consistent scoring procedures. Some tests assess behavior in relation to population norms. Many are indirect measures of behavior and most do not produce results that can be directly translated into target behavior. Curriculum-based assessments can be direct measure of academic behavior. Administration of standardized tests is often controlled by licensing requirements. Direct observation consists of direct and repeated observation of the client's behavior in their natural environment. Observation requires the full attention of the observer on the person of interest for a specified period of time. Direct observation yields a descriptive, temporally sequenced account of antecedents, behaviors, and consequences. Observations contain descriptions of target behaviors that can be used for intervention.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Chapter 3 Answer Key</cell></row><row><cell>Multiple Choice</cell></row><row><cell>1.

A general goal can result in the focus of intervention being placed on related and indirect behaviors that are not really the intended outcomes of the intervention. A more specific outcome goal should be used that addresses the specific, observable behavior which, when mastered, will result in the more global goal being achieved. For example, a general goal of on-task behavior can be achieved by directly targeting attention to materials, task completion, and remaining seated.10. A behavior cusp is a behavior that exposes the person to new environments, specifically to new reinforcers and punishers, new responses, new stimulus controls, and new communities of maintaining or destructive contingencies. An example is learning to read. A pivotal behavior is a behavior that produces corresponding modifications or co-variations in other adaptive, untrained behaviors (e.g., attending behavior).11. Including clients, family, and/or staff in the goal determination process can minimize and resolve conflicts in the priorities of different stakeholders. Active participation can avoid and resolve goal conflicts by increasing communication and awareness of assessment outcomes.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Chapter 4 Answer Key</cell></row><row><cell>Multiple Choice</cell></row><row><cell>1.

Answer should include:A complete and precise operational definition is the first step to achieving a high level of treatment integrity. It provides the basis for training those who will implement the intervention and those who will judge the level of treatment integrity obtained. Precise definitions are a requisite for meeting the technological dimension of applied behavior analysis. Failure to provide a precise operational definition hampers dissemination and proper use of the intervention and makes replication and validation of the experiment impossible.6. Answer should include: External validity refers to the degree to which a functional relation found reliable and socially valid in a given experiment will hold under different conditions. The generality of findings in applied behavior analysis research is assessed, established, and specified through replication of experiments, both direct and systematic. Answer should include: First, applied behavior analysts are concerned with producing socially significant, not statistically significant change. If a problem is solved, you can see that in the data. If the change is so small or unclear that statistical treatment is necessary, the problem has not been solved. Second, visual analysis is well suited for identifying variables that produce strong, large, and reliable results. Visual analysis is less likely to produce Type I errors but increases the commission of Type II errors. Third, statistical methods remove or cancel out variability in the data. If there is a significant amount of variability, more analysis should be conducted, as the answer to the problem is not yet clear. Fourth, statistical tests require the data to conform to predetermined criteria for analysis. This results in less flexibility in experimental design which is highly valued in applied behavior analysis. Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.9. Answer should include: Shift needs to occur toward a more complete analysis and conceptual understanding of the principles that underlie successful demonstrations of behavior change. The field's concept of analytic has changed. Applied behavior analysis is now considered analytic when it makes convincing demonstrations of behavior change AND when the behavior change methods make systematic and conceptual sense. Both conditions are now expected in order to be truly analytic.</figDesc><table><row><cell>7.

Of the two, nonexclusion time-out is the least restrictive. Exclusion time-out also has more limitations, including the individual may resist going or engage in emotional outbursts, it typically requires more supervision to monitor the individual's safety and to prevent the individual from potentially engaging in destructive and/or self-stimulatory behavior, and it results in the student accessing less instructional time compared to nonexclusion time-out.2. Answers should include: Time-out is defined by procedural, conceptual, and functional factors/perspectives. Procedural: Time-out involves immediately removing the individual from the time-in setting, where they are able to access reinforcers, to the time-out setting where reinforcement is not available for a specific period of time contingent on engagement in the problem behavior. Conceptual: The individual must be able to discriminate between the time-in and time-out settings. That is, the time-in setting should be noticeably more reinforcing than the time-out setting. Functional: Time-out, by definition, must result in a decrease in the future occurrences of the problem behavior.

Functional communication training (FCT) is an antecedent intervention that establishes an appropriate communication behavior to compete with problem behaviors evoked by an establishing operation. Alternative responses can include vocalizations, signs, communication boards, words or picture cards, vocal output systems, and gestures. FCT is an application of DRA because it selects a specific alternative response that is developed in the individual's repertoire as a functionally equivalent response to the problem behavior. Effective use of FCT includes dense schedules of reinforcement, decreased use of verbal prompts, behavior reduction procedures, and schedule thinning. FCT is different from NCR and high-p request sequence because it develops alternative behaviors that are sensitive to the EO's. Copyright © 2020 Pearson Education, Inc.

When looking at the videotaped sessions, the researcher noticed toward the end of the project, the staff implementing the procedures was accepting "hands in lap" and "sitting on hands" as well as "folding hands" as a correct response. Additionally, the staff was only using verbal praise as a reinforcer and not the point system as in the original training phase. These changes challenge the ______ of the study, due to the lack of ________.  A. While working on a project, a child asked the teacher, "How do you spell aardvark?" B. While walking through the sanctuary, the child saw a Bengal tiger and said, "big cat". C. The toddler said "beep" while pinching another child's nose and then the other child said, "beep". D.

What is the difference between momentary DRO and interval DRO?</p><p>A. A momentary DRO is usually conducted for shorter time intervals than an interval DRO. B. In a momentary DRO, the individual is required to engage in an incompatible behavior at the moment the interval ends, and in an interval DRO the target behavior must be absent throughout the whole interval. C. In a momentary DRO, the observer looks for the behavior at the moment the interval ends, and in an interval DRO, the observer looks for the behavior throughout the entire interval. D. A momentary DRO is usually more effective early on in its implementation, and an interval DRO is more effective later in its implementation.</p><p>True/False 1. TRUE or FALSE.

Reinforcing in-seat behavior for a child who frequently engages in out-ofseat behavior is an example of DRI.</p><p>3. TRUE or FALSE. When selecting a DRA or DRI replacement response, one should select a behavior that is not in the learner's current repertoire in order to avoid accidentally reinforcing something associated with the problem behavior.</p><p>4.

The teacher asked the child to "touch your nose" and allowed a break from the activity if the child complied. B. The teacher asked the child to count the blocks and after the child complied, gave three simple rapid requests. C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TRUE.</head><p>5. FALSE. The effects of work duration on task aversion are idiosyncratic to the learner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer/Essay</head><p>1. Answers should include: With escape, the aversive stimulus is present prior to the response, which terminates the aversive stimulus. With avoidance, the aversive stimulus is not present prior to the response. Engagement in the response prevents the presentation of the aversive stimulus from occurring.</p><p>2. Answers should include a clear MO (aversive stimulus), the S D , the behavior, and termination of the aversive.</p><p>3. Answers should include the schedule for the onset of the aversive in the absence of the avoidance response, the aversive stimulus, the avoidance behavior, and the consequence (delayed presentation of the aversive).</p><p>4. Answers should include at least one of the following: A) People often think that negative reinforcement is the opposite of positive reinforcement and therefore, assume negative reinforcement means punishment. However, the terms "positive" and "negative" refer to the presentation and removal of stimuli rather than the "goodness" or "badness" of the stimuli. B) People confuse negative reinforcement and punishment because they both involve the use of aversive stimuli. However, with negative reinforcement, the aversive stimulus is presented prior to the occurrence of the target behavior (resulting in an increase in the behavior over time). Whereas with punishment, the aversive stimulus follows the occurrence of the target behavior (resulting in a decrease in the target behavior over time). 2. FALSE. This describes negative reinforcement. Positive punishment occurs when the presentation of an aversive stimulus decreases the future occurrence of the behavior.</p><p>3. TRUE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">FALSE.</head><p>Reinforcement involves an increase in behavior. Punishment involves a decrease in behavior. Negative and positive refer to the mathematic operations of subtraction and addition. Negativea stimulus is removed from the environment. Positivea stimulus is added to the environment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>The stimulus discrimination process requires two stimuli. The practitioner consistently reinforces the occurrence of a target response in the presence if one stimulus and does not reinforce the target response in the presence of the other stimulus. Examples will vary, but there must be a clear S D and S-delta.</p><p>3. Answers will vary. Answers should provide clear examples of stimulus discrimination across classes and stimulus generalization within the class. For example, balls of different shades of red are all "red" (stimulus generalization). However, a green ball would not be considered in the same class because it is a different color (stimulus discrimination).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>Four ways to transfer stimulus control from prompts to natural stimuli are: Most-to least prompts, least-to-most prompts, time delay, and graduated guidance. In most-to-least prompts, one begins with the most intrusive prompt (physical guidance) and fades back to least intrusive prompts (verbal prompts) as the learner progresses. In least-to-most prompts, one begins with the least intrusive prompt and systematically increases the prompt intrusiveness until the correct response is made. With time delay, variations occur in the time interval between the presentation of the natural stimulus and the presentation of a response prompt. This delay can be constant or progressive. Graduated guidance consists of quickly fading physical prompts within the prompt itself. For example, a practitioner may begin to physically guide a person through a task, but slowly fade the physical guidance within the step as the individual begins to complete the step independently. 8. FALSE. Both the single-and multiple-opportunity assessment methods can be implemented multiple times. However, with the single-opportunity methods, the instructor ends the assessment following the learner's first error. With the multiple-opportunity method, the assessment continues through all steps of the skill, despite the learner's engagement in errors. 9. TRUE.</p><p>10. FALSE. None of the methods has been shown to be more effective than the others.</p><p>11. FALSE. With backward chaining, the learner completes the steps in the correct order. However, the learner is taught the individual steps by starting with the last one first. That is, the instructor targets the last step of the chain first, followed by the second to last step, etc. 2. FALSE. This is the definition of resurgence. An extinction burst is a rapid increase in the frequency and/or intensity of the target behavior following cessation of reinforcement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short Answer</head><p>3. TRUE. For seriously harmful behaviors where rapid reduction is necessary, extinction as a singular intervention should not be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TRUE.</head><p>If all sources of reinforcement cannot be held, the extinction procedure will be ineffective. Therefore, extinction should not be used when it is clear that the practitioner cannot effectively control access to the reinforcer. 4. Answers will vary. Answers should include three of the following factors that should be considered when teaching sufficient stimulus examples with a brief discussion of each: complexity of the target behavior; the teaching procedures employed; learner's opportunities to emit the target behavior under various conditions; naturally existing contingencies of reinforcement; and the learner's history of reinforcement for generalized responding.</p></div>			</div>
