<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface to the Third Edition</head><p>M y frst experience in ethics came when I was a graduate stu- dent in psychology in the late 1960s. I was working with a profoundly developmentally disabled young man who was confned to a heavy metal crib in the small ward of a private institution in Phoenix, Arizona. Blind, deaf, non-ambulatory, and not toilet trained, my "subject" engaged in self-injurious behavior virtually all day long. His head-banging behavior against the metal bars could be heard 25 yards away and greeted me each time I entered his depressing, malodorous living unit. Day afer day, I sat by his crib taking notes on a possible thesis concerning how one might try to reduce his chronic self-injurious behavior or SIB (we called it self-destructive behavior in those days). Afer a few informal observation sessions, and reading through his medical chart, I had some ideas. I set up a meeting with one of my committee members, Dr. Lee Meyerson, who was supervising the research at the facility. "I'm observing a subject who engages in self-destructive behavior," I began. "He hits his head 10 to 15 times per minute throughout the day. I've taken informal data at dif erent times of the day, and I don't see any consistent pattern," I of ered. Dr. Meyerson let me go on for about 10 minutes, nodding and occasionally taking a puf on his pipe (smoking was allowed everywhere in those days). Ten he stopped me abruptly and, gesturing with his pipe, began to ask me questions that I had never thought about. Did I know my "subject's" name? Did I have permission to observe and report on this individual? Who gave me permission to look at this medical record? Had I discussed this case with any of my graduate student colleagues or shown the data in class? I had no good answers to any of Dr. Meyerson's questions. I wasn't thinking of my "subject" as a person, only as a source of data for my thesis. It never dawned on me that "Billy" had rights to privacy and conf dentiality and that he needed to be treated with dignity and respect, not as just another "subject" to help me complete a degree requirement. As it turns out, Dr. Meyerson was ahead of his time in grilling me with ethical questions that would not be addressed in legal circles for another ten years (see Chapter 1). Dr. Meyerson's questions helped sensitize me to looking at what I was doing from an extra-experimental perspective. How would I like to be treated if I was a subject in someone's experiment? Or how would I want my mother or sister to be treated? "With kindness, compassion and respect" is no doubt the quick response that most of us would ofer. And so it is that ethics in psychology, and particularly in behavior analysis, can be easily personalized and made tangible if we will just stop and think about what we are doing.</p><p>Students today have a great advantage over my generation. We had no code of ethics to guide us; we had one foot in the animal lab and one in the world of academia, and we were trying to f gure out how to transform powerful operant conditioning principles into efective treatments. It didn't dawn on us at the time that ethics was involved at all, until, of course, we encountered Dr. Meyerson. Today, graduate students in behavior analysis have nearly 50 years of applied research and practice to fall back on (and to learn from and be held accountable for knowing). In addition, they have a wealth of resources on ethics, including case law and precedent-setting legal fndings. Finally, students today have a perfectly legitimate, thoroughly researched, and well-vetted ethics code specifcally designed for our f eld. T e current version of this document is the BACB Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts. In teaching the graduate course "Professional and Ethical Issues in Behavior Analysis" for the past 15 years, I have learned a great deal about the ethical issues that appear to be unique to our feld and have been developing lectures and trying to discover ways of making ethics interesting, informative, and engaging for students who do not quite see the relevance or appreciate our cautious approach. One thing I've discovered is that although we now have an excellent ethics code, it is somewhat dry and by itself, it does not convey the urgency and relevance that it should. Reading the Code is something like reading instructions for computer sofware: it's clearly important, but you would rather just start using it.</p><p>Years ago, I was scheduled to give a half-day workshop at Penn State on ethics at the urging of Dr. Jerry Shook. In the process of preparing my materials, I wondered what kind of ethical questions the participants might have. Dr. Shook arranged in advance to have each participant write and submit to us two questions or "scenarios" that they had confronted in the work setting. When I got the questions, I realized that reading the scenarios suddenly made the ethical issues jump right of the page. I began trying to look up the correct responses (according to what was then called the BACB Guidelines), and this turned out to be quite dif cult. Something was missing. An index of some sort would help, but none was available that I could fnd. Several all-nighters later, I had developed one. By the time Dr. Shook and I traveled to the conference, I had a new approach to teaching ethics. It involved presenting scenarios, having the students look up the relevant sections in the Guidelines for Responsible Conduct, and then having them present their proposed ethical actions. Tis approach teaches students that sometimes broad, ethical considerations always come down to some specifc code items. My experience in using this method over the past several years is that it brings the topic to life and generates excellent discussions of very relevant issues.</p><p>One troubling problem I encountered in teaching the "Ethics for Behavior Analysis" course was that specifc code items were ofen very much out of context or written in such stilted legalese that students did not understand why they were necessary or how they were relevant. I found myself ofen "translating" specifc items into plain English. Tis process, along with providing some historic context and background about how and why certain items were important in our feld, seemed to increase the level of understanding for the students.</p><p>Tis book, then, is the culmination of this attempt to present a practical, student-centered approach to teaching ethics in behavior analysis. All of the cases are based on real examples but edited so as to avoid embarrassment or legal hassles, and the authors of the cases gave permission for their use (those in quotation marks are direct quotes from submitted cases). In addition, for each case, there is a commentary at the end of each chapter.</p><p>A fnal word about using this volume: this text is intended to be a practical handbook, and we specifcally attempted to avoid making this an academic or theoretical work. Many people teaching ethics courses will routinely have students read the US Constitution, view One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and research their state laws on limits of treatment, requirements for keeping documents, maintaining confdentiality, and other relevant issues. My experience is that it takes some creative digging to f nd relevant readings. Exposing students to a variety of sources, from Skinner and Sidman to Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) position statements, is useful in preparing them to tackle the world of ethical issues they will confront. We have tried to summarize what we consider the most important and pressing issues for new Board Certifed Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) in Chapter 15, "A Dozen Practical Tips for Ethical Conduct on Your First Job." We hope you enjoy using this book and welcome input and dialogue on efective ways of teaching this most important topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preface to the Fourth Edition</head><p>M uch has happened in the world of behavior analysts in the last fve years. Te profession has nearly doubled in size, and the demand for services has totally outstripped our ability to provide qualifed therapists, supervisors, and administrators. Economic pressures have come into play, as government agencies and insurance companies are tightening the purse strings, making it harder and harder to get reimbursement for services, while more and more families are desperate to receive the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) gold standard treatment for their loved one. Tere is a concern in many agencies that new behavior analysts are not being trained as thoroughly as they have been in the past in part due to the pressure to rush them out the door. Tis demand may have come at the cost of thorough hands-on training at practicum sites. Tere is an equal fear that new graduates are not receiving intensive enough training in the ethics of service delivery and even the basic principles and worldview of behavior analysis. Others are pointing out that trainees in ABA are not being properly schooled in cultural responsiveness and are xiii xiv â¢ Preface to the Fourth Edition not prepared to deal with diversity issues with their clients and colleagues. Tis new code deals extensively with these concerns plus additional questions of exploitative relationships, and a longstanding and pervasive problem of dual relationships. All these topics and more are presented in preview format in Chapter 2. As in the previous edition, we rely heavily on case examples based on questions submitted to the ABA Ethics Hotline to illustrate the ethical problems that behavior analysts can expect to encounter on a weekly basis. It is hoped by studying actual practice and ethical dilemmas that new Board Certifed Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) will be better prepared to take on a complex world of behavior analysis service delivery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOW TO USE THIS FOURTH EDITION</head><p>Each year, I teach a semester-long graduate course called "Ethics and Professional Issues for Behavior Analysts." I use Ethics for Behavior Analysts for the frst half of the semester, and for the second half I use 25 Essential Skills for the Successful Behavior Analyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bailey &amp; Burch, 2022)</ref>. By covering ethics frst, I f nd the students become sensitized to the new way of thinking about how they should conduct themselves; then I introduce them to all the other professional skills they will need to be successful in following through with the intent of the new ethics code.</p><p>We hope that this fourth edition of Ethics for Behavior Analysts will be useful as you learn about and teach others about ethics.</p><p>-Jon S. <ref type="bibr">Bailey</ref> T o paraphrase an African proverb, "It takes a village to write a book." I arrived at this conclusion about one month into gathering notes, quotes, references, questions, case examples, and nuggets of wisdom from many people that I know, have just met, and deeply respect. I would frst like to thank those members of the Ethics Hotline Advisory Committee who contributed directly to this work. Tomas Zane, Yulema Cruz, Mary Jane Weiss, Noor Syed, Devon Sundberg, Rosemary Condillac, and Michele Silcox always responded immediately to my pleas and gave good honest advice. Tom wrote the chapter on research, Yulema tracked down supervision ethics questions, and the rest wrote responses to those questions or reviewed draf pages and ofered their expertise graciously on every occasion that I made a request. I would also like to thank Zack Stevens, a former student who now has his own ABA agency in Tennessee and who provided sample documents that could be used to illustrate specifc aspects of the new ethics code. Other former students who reviewed pages of writing were Loren Eighme and Hope McNally. Teir experience in the feld as Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) and Board Certifed Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) added an extra dimension xv xvi â¢ Acknowledgments of authenticity to the book. Robert Wallander and Ken Wagner helped me sort through the OBM side of the ethics equation. Lauren Beaulieu educated me about cultural competence. Noor Syed and Nasiah Cirincione-Ulezi shared their expertise on cultural humility, which is far more complicated than it sounds. Elizabeth Zeppernick reviewed drafs of my commentaries on using testimonials from current and former clients in advertising and non-advertising campaigns. Two additional former students, Nikki Dickens and Kolton Sellers, gave me a better understanding of the ins and outs of social media. Tis book would not have been possible without all of you-T ank You.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disclaimer</head><p>T his book does not represent an ofcial statement by the Behavior Analyst Certifcation Board, the Association for Behavior Analysis International, the Florida Association for Behavior Analysis, or any other behavior analysis organization of which the authors are members. Tis text cannot be relied on as the only interpretation of the meaning of the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts or the application of this code to specif c situations. Each Board Certifed Behavior Analyst, supervisor, or relevant agency must interpret and apply the code as they believe proper, given all the circumstances.</p><p>Te cases used in this book are based on the authors' combined 75 years of experience in behavior analysis. In all cases, we have disguised the situations and used pseudonyms to protect the privacy of the parties and organizations involved. At the end of some of the chapters, we ofer "Responses to Cases" as examples of real solutions to the ethical problems posed by the case. We do not hold these to be the only ethical solutions, but rather, each response is an example of one ethical solution. We encourage instructors who use the text to create alternate solutions based on their own xvii experiences. Finally, we hope that the responses ofered here will stimulate discussion, debate, and thoughtful consideration about ways of handling what are by defnition very delicate matters with possible life-changing consequences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background for Ethics in Behavior Analysis</head><p>promoters promised dramatic changes in behavior that were quick and easy to produce and could be carried out by almost anyone with an attendance certifcate from a daylong "behavior mod" workshop. People calling themselves "behavior modif ers" of ered rented-hotel-ballroom training sessions in abundance. T ere were no prerequisites for registering, and no questions were asked about the speaker's qualif cations. Te basic pitch was this:</p><p>You don't have to know why a behavior occurs (it was assumed to be learned-an "operant behavior"); you need to know only how to manipulate consequences. Food is a primary reinforcer for almost everybody; just make it contingent on the behavior you want. For inappropriate or dangerous behavior, use consequences (punishers) to "decelerate" the behavior.</p><p>Tere was no consideration given to the notion of "causes" of behavior or that there might be a connection between a likely cause and an efective treatment. Further, no thought was given to possible side efects of using food (e.g., food allergies, weight gain) or how the food, ofen candy, might be handled. Indeed, Cheerios, M&amp;Ms, pretzels, and other bite-sized snacks and treats were loaded in the pockets of the "behavior specialist" in the morning and used throughout the day as needed (a hungry behavior specialist might even have a few from time to time). Likewise, aversive consequences were used with abandon in informal, impromptu, and spontaneous reactions to self-injurious, destructive, and inappropriate behaviors. Some staf members were urged to "be creative" in coming up with consequences. As a result, hot pepper sauces such as Tabasco and undiluted lemon juice might be seen in the jacket pockets of staf members who were on their way to work on "the behavior unit."</p><p>In the early 1970s, "the unit" was frequently a residential facility for individuals with developmental disabilities who had moderate to severe mental retardation, some physical disabilities, and troublesome behaviors. It was most likely a former veterans' or tuberculosis hospital, which might house 300 to 1,500 "patients."</p><p>Custodial care was the norm until "behavior mod" came along and ofered dramatic treatment for severe behavior problems. With no code of ethics and essentially no restrictions, this "treatment" quickly drifed into f at-out abuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE SUNLAND MIAMI SCANDAL</head><p>Te Sunland Training Center in Miami became ground zero for an abuse investigation that rocked the state of Florida in 1972. T e center had been plagued by high turnover rates since it opened in 1965, resulting in frequent understafng and low-quality training. Surprisingly, the majority of staf serving as "cottage parents" were college students. In 1969, the superintendent resigned under pressure from an investigation into "allegations of resident abuse." It seems that he confned two residents in a "cell improvised from a large trailer" <ref type="bibr">(McAllister, 1972, p. 2)</ref>. Ten, in April 1971, the Florida Division of Mental Retardation and the Dade County Attorney's ofce began an intensive investigation of resident abuse and concluded afer a 6-month inquiry regarding allegations of "infrequent and isolated cases of abuse" (p. 2) that the superintendent had dealt with the employees involved and taken appropriate disciplinary action. One of those professional employees, Dr. E., challenged his reassignment, and a grievance committee then uncovered what it considered to be a "highly explosive situation" involving resident abuse with the apparent knowledge and approval of top administrators. As a result, seven individuals were immediately suspended, including the superintendent, the director of cottage life, the staf psychologist, three cottage supervisors, and a cottage parent. Each was charged with "misfeasance, malfeasance, negligence, and contributing to the abuse of residents" (p. 4). Subsequently, Jack McAllister, the director of the State Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS) Division of Retardation, formed a nine-member blue-ribbon panel, the "Resident Abuse Investigating Committee," composed of experts in retardation as well as an attorney, a social worker, a client advocate, and two behavior analysts (Dr. <ref type="bibr">Jack May Jr. and Dr. Todd Risley)</ref>. Interviews were set up with more than 70 individuals, including current staf members, former employees, residents, and relatives of residents (including one whose son died at Sunland Miami), with some interviews lasting 10 hours. Te committee also examined original logs, internal memoranda, a personal diary, and personnel records.</p><p>It seems that Dr. E., a psychologist who had joined the staf in 1971 and who had presented himself as an expert in behavior modifcation, had set up a truly ironically named program called the "Achievement Division" in three cottages, allegedly to study "some rather esoteric questions of statistical models for economic analysis" <ref type="bibr">(McAllister, 1972, p. 15)</ref>. Dr. E., over the next year, established a "treatment" program that consisted of, or evolved into, abusive incidents including the following: forced public masturbation (for residents caught masturbating); forced public homosexual acts (again for those caught in the act); forced washing of the mouth with soap (as punishment for lying, abusive language, or simply speaking at all); beatings with a wooden paddle (ten "licks" for running away); and excessive use of restraints, including one resident who was restrained for more than 24 hours and another who was forced to sit in a bathtub for 2 days. Restraints were routinely used as punishment rather than an emergency method of preventing self-injury. As if this were not enough, the list of horrif c, systematic abuses goes on: a male client required to wear women's underpants; excessive use of lengthy (e.g., four-hour) seclusions in barren and unpadded rooms with no permission to leave to use Dr. E. established a "treatment" program that consisted of forced public masturbation, forced public homosexual acts, forced washing of the mouth with soap, beatings with a wooden paddle, and excessive use of restraints.</p><p>the bathroom; public shaming by forcing a resident to wear a sign that said "T e Tief"; food or sleep withheld as a form of punishment; another resident forced to hold feces-stained underwear under his nose for 10 minutes as punishment for incontinence; and another resident forced to lie on urine-soaked sheets for repeated incontinence <ref type="bibr">(pp. 10-11)</ref>.</p><p>Te "milieu" of the Achievement Division consisted of an utter lack of programmed activities, which resulted in "profound boredom and deterioration, unattractive surroundings, complete lack of privacy, public humiliation, nakedness . . . and lack of any means of residents to express their grievances" <ref type="bibr">(McAllister, 1972, p. 13)</ref>. One resident died from dehydration, and another drowned These revolting acts of in a nearby canal in his futile attempt to escape his cottage abuse were the result of at Sunland Miami.</p><p>an attempt by Dr. E. to At frst glance it might create a "superb behavior appear that such abuses would modifi cation program." certainly have to be the work of a few frustrated, angry, poorly trained employees bent on sadistic acts. However, the investigation revealed the contrary: these revolting acts of abuse were the result of an attempt by Dr. E. to create a "superb behavior modifcation program" <ref type="bibr">( McAllister, 1972 , p. 14)</ref> using routine "behavior shaping devices" (p. 15). Te committee's explanation was that this program "degenerated . . . into a bizarre, abusive, and inefective system of punishment" (p. 17). In the Achievement Division, these procedures were systematically applied, condoned by supervisors and professional staf, and recorded in daily living unit logs. Te procedures not only were used openly but also were, at least initially, well researched. Dr. James Lent, a well-respected expert in behavioral treatment, for example, modeled a token program afer one frst developed in Parsons, Kansas. One key ingredient was lef out of this and other aspects of the Achievement Division: monitoring of individual resident behavior. Rather, the emphasis was on guidelines for treatment that gave the otherwise poorly trained employees a great deal of latitude in their reactions. Te three guidelines were as follows: (1) emphasize "natural consequences of behavior"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(2)</ref> devise your own immediate response to problem behaviors that might crop up where no other instructions apply; and (3) do not threaten; if you verbalize a consequence to a resident, "follow through on every contingency. "</p><p>Te investigating committee was adamant in its observation that none of the cruel and abusive procedures employed in the Achievement Division had any basis in the behavior modif cation literature or "any other modern therapeutic or educational methodology." Tey went on to suggest that because the cottage where the abuses took place was totally isolated from outside monitoring, it was entirely possible for "well-meaning but poorly trained personnel" to try some mild form of these procedures and then gradually escalate to the bizarre applications that were ultimately achieved. Each instance was, as noted previously, in a daily logbook, and, given no corrective action or response, a cottage parent would naturally assume tacit approval and then perhaps employ a "slightly more extreme form" of the procedure.</p><p>In this way, quite extreme procedures evolved in gradual steps from spontaneous initiation of less extreme procedures by the cottage staf, until . . . a pattern had been established of dealing with recurrent problems by escalating the intensity of whatever procedures happened to be in use for a particular resident. <ref type="bibr">(McAllister, 1972, pp. 17-18)</ref> Tis natural tendency toward "behavior drif" on the part of the staf is certainly not uncommon in residential treatment facilities.</p><p>In the case of Sunland Miami, it was facilitated by a nearly total lack of monitoring by upper-level management. Te written policies at Sunland Miami clearly prohibited abusive practices, but there was no evidence that these were "forcefully communicated" to employees, and, as was previously mentioned, the facility suf ered from chronic turnover of staf , so ongoing staf training was superfcial at best. Another concern of the investigating committee had to do with the training and credentials of Dr. E. As it turns out, he had recently graduated with his doctoral degree from the University of Florida and then had completed some postdoctoral work at Johns Hopkins University. He claimed to have worked with some of the biggest names in the feld. However, when the committee contacted them, these eminent researchers "vaguely remembered a brash young man who visited their laboratories on several occasions," but none would claim him as his student <ref type="bibr">(McAllister, 1972, p. 19</ref>). It must be remembered that Dr. E. was trained in the late 1960s when the feld was in its infancy, and it appeared that the sky was the limit as far as behavior modifcation was concerned. T e Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, the professional journal of behavior analysis, had frst been published only in 1968, so there was very little research on the application of behavior principles, and there was no code of ethics for behavioral researchers or practitioners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BLUEïºRIBBON COMMITTEE</head><p>Te investigating committee took on itself the additional responsibility of making recommendations to hopefully prevent any future systematic abuses in the name of behavior modif cation in the state of Florida. Tese included strong support for a statewide advocacy program in which staf members would be allowed to make unannounced visits to residential institutions and to collect information from key personnel as well as residents, parents, staf, and concerned citizens. In addition, the committee recommended professional peer review of all behavior programs to ensure that treatment was derived from the literature and that no procedures would be used that were considered "experimental." Experimental programs would come under standard review for human experimentation in the HRS Division of Retardation. Other recommendations of the committee included (1) the prohibition of certain bizarre examples of punishment and (2) abandoning seclusion in favor of "positive and appropriate 'time out' techniques" <ref type="bibr">(McAllister, 1972, p. 31)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FOLLOWïºUP</head><p>In most cases, a report such as that produced by the blue-ribbon committee would simply fnd its way to the shelves of state bureaucrats and languish with no lasting efect. Such was not the case in Florida. Te Florida Association for Retarded Children (now the Arc of Florida) took up the cause of humane treatment and ultimately endorsed the notion of supporting data-based behavioral treatment, using strict guidelines, under close supervision by properly trained professionals.</p><p>Te Division of Retardation, Charles Cox instituted under the guidance of Charles Cox, instituted reforms includ-reforms including setting ing setting up both statewide up both statewide and local and local peer review com-peer review committees mittees for behavior modif cafor behavior modifi cation tion programming in facilities programming in facilities throughout Florida.</p><p>Te Statewide Peer Review throughout Florida.</p><p>Committee for Behavior Modifcation (PRC) then established a set of guidelines for the use of behavioral procedures, which were subsequently adopted by the National Association for Retarded Citizens and by the Florida Division of Retardation in the Health and Rehabilitative Services Manual (HRSM) 160-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(May et al., 1976)</ref>. Te state-funded PRC proceeded to make visits to institutions around the state over the next several years, educating staf members about the guidelines and making recommendations for more ethical treatment. By 1980, the PRC reached a consensus that it was time to encourage all the institutions, group homes, and smaller residential facilities to begin networking with one another and to begin to bring some sense of professionalism to behavior analysis in Florida. T e "First Florida Work Session on Behavior Analysis in Retardation" was held in September 1980 and drew nearly 300 administrators, treatment specialists, behavior analysts, and direct care staf to the two-day conference, held in Orlando. At this historic conference, a meeting was held to organize an of cial state association. T e frst annual conference of the Florida Association for Behavior Analysis (FABA) was held in 1981, again in Orlando. None other than B. F. Skinner was the keynote speaker. Te formation of FABA marked a turning point in behavior analysis, not only in Florida but also in the rest of the country. It was now possible to set high expectations for behavioral treatment because leaders in the feld were routinely being brought to state conferences to present their latest applied behavioral research, and practitioners had an opportunity to see frsthand what others were doing in other parts of the country to solve some of the most intractable behavior problems of the day. Administrators from state government and private facilities were able to see that behavior analysis was not just some local phenomenon but rather was an approach to treatment that was legitimate, efective, and humane. T e PRC, in conjunction with FABA, began the process of certifying behavior analysts via a testing program sponsored by the Division of Retardation. In 1988, FABA membership adopted the FABA Code of Ethics, the frst state association to do so.</p></div>

Without the abuses, there would have been no blueribbon committee formed to think seriously about how to protect individuals with developmental disabilities from systematic abuse of behavioral procedures. Te headlines resulted in the intense scrutiny of a treatment mode that was in its infancy and that needed guidelines and oversight. Te pain and sufering of the individuals with developmental disabilities involved in the abuses amplifed the need to think clearly about the ethics of treatment. Although it would have been easier to prohibit behavior modifcation altogether, the blue-ribbon committee was convinced by its two behavioral advocates, Dr. May and Dr. Risley, that a better alternative was to establish strict guidelines for treatment and to set up an infrastructure for oversight involving community citizens who would bring their values, common sense, and good judgment to evaluate behavioral treatment strategies on an ongoing basis. Te notion of oversight by both human rights and peer review committees gave teeth to the public appraisal of behavior analysis. Tese actions, plus the development of a state-endorsed mechanism of certifcation, the evolution of a strong state professional organization, and its promotion of a code of ethics for behavior analysts, put in place all the necessary elements of control and management to prevent future abuses. And ethics, af er all, is concerned primarily with the edict to "do no harm." In the Florida case, we saw how great harm could be done by wellmeaning people, and that abuse was prevented when appropriate, comprehensive strategies were adopted. Although ethics is usually seen as an individual professional engaging in responsible behavior of his or her own volition, the Florida case suggests that responsible conduct can be</p><p>The pain and suffering clearly about the ethics of Indeed, it is hard to imagine treatment.</p><p>such powerful procedures as behavioral treatments being used consistently across the board in the absence of such obvious forms of oversight and control.</p><p>It is also clear that, even given these mechanisms, the behavior analyst faces numerous questions every day about the appropriateness of treatment decisions. What is fair? What is right? Am I qualifed to administer this treatment? Can I do no harm? Am I taking enough data? Am I interpreting it correctly? Would my client be better of with no treatment? It is the purpose of this volume to try to elucidate the current Behavior Analyst Certif cation Board (BACB) Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts to assist the behavior analyst in making right choices on a daily basis.</p><p>In the 2022 code, there is one clarifcation about romantic and sexual relationships that is much needed but is still lef vague. We have provided some discussion about this topic at the end of this chapter.</p><p>In this chapter, the additions to the 2022 code as written by the BACB are listed frst. Immediately afer each addition is a summary statement by the authors. Te section on additions to the code is followed by the deletions or "moved" items, and f nally, one clarifcation concludes the chapter.</p><p>We intend the term supervisees to include trainees, students and RBTs. When we say clients, this includes stakeholders of all sorts including parents, and when we refer to a company, we mean for this to include agencies, clinics, businesses, and organizations both for proft and non-prof t.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.07">Cultural Responsiveness and Diversity</head><p>Behavior analysts actively engage in professional development activities to acquire knowledge and skills related to cultural responsiveness and diversity. Tey evaluate their own biases and ability to address the needs of individuals with diverse needs/backgrounds (e.g., age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio economic status). Behavior analysts also evaluate biases of their supervisees and trainees, as well as their supervisees' and trainees' ability to address the needs of individuals with diverse needs/backgrounds. Summary : Tis new code requires that behavior analysts "acquire knowledge and skills related to cultural responsiveness and diversity" and that they "evaluate their own biases" as well as those of their supervisees and their ability to meet the needs of clients with "diverse needs/backgrounds." [See Chapter 6 for details .]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.10">Awareness of Personal Biases and Challenges</head><p>Behavior analysts maintain awareness that their personal biases or challenges (e.g., mental or physical health conditions; legal, fnancial, marital/relationship challenges) may interfere with the efectiveness of their professional work. Behavior analysts take appropriate steps to resolve interference, ensure that their professional work is not compromised, and document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Summary: Tis new code is related to 1.07 and additionally requires one to "maintain awareness" of their personal biases and certain health and other conditions that might af ect their work. Behavior analysts are advised to "take appropriate steps" to resolve any issues so that their work is not compromised.</p><p>[See Chapter <ref type="bibr">6 .]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.11">Multiple Relationships</head><p>Because multiple relationships may result in a conf ict of interest that might harm one or more parties, behavior analysts avoid entering into or creating multiple relationships, including professional, personal, and familial relationships with clients and colleagues. Behavior analysts communicate the risks of multiple relationships to relevant individuals and continually monitor for the development of multiple relationships. If multiple relationships arise, behavior analysts take appropriate steps to resolve them. When immediately resolving a multiple relationship is not possible, behavior analysts develop appropriate safeguards to identify and avoid conf icts of interest in compliance with the Code and develop a plan to eventually resolve the multiple relationship. Behavior analysts document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Summary: While mention of multiple relationships is not new, what is changed here is that a description of confict of interest has been moved to the Glossary. Tis standard does say that a multiple relationship may cause a conf ict of interest, and it goes on to say that if either of these occurs, the situation needs to be "resolved." [See Chapter <ref type="bibr">6 .]</ref> 1.12 Giving and Receiving Gif s Because the exchange of gifs can invite conf icts of interest and multiple relationships, behavior analysts do not give gif s to or accept gifs from clients, stakeholders, supervisees, or trainees with a monetary value of more than $10 US dollars (or the equivalent purchasing power in another currency). Behavior analysts make clients and stakeholders aware of this requirement at the onset of the professional relationship. A gif is acceptable if it functions as an infrequent expression of gratitude and does not result in f nancial beneft to the recipient. Instances of giving or accepting ongoing or cumulative gifs may rise to the level of a violation of this standard if the gifs become a regularly expected source of income or value to the recipient . Summary: Gifs of "gratitude" up to $10 are now allowed on an "infrequent" basis and ongoing or cumulative gifs may be a violation. We interpret "infrequent" to mean annually, such as at annual traditional gif giving holidays like Christmas, Hanukkah, or Chinese New Year. [See Chapter <ref type="bibr">6 .]</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.02">Timeliness</head><p>Behavior analysts deliver services and carry out necessary servicerelated administrative responsibilities in a timely manner. Summary : Tis code item is self-explanatory. Te idea is that not only should clinical sessions and supervision be carried out in a timely manner, but administrative responsibilities such as f ling reports and staying current with billing are also important. [See <ref type="bibr">Chapter 7 .]</ref> 2.17 Collecting and Using Data Behavior analysts implement fee practices and share fee information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Tey do not misrepresent their fees. In situations where behavior analysts are not directly responsible for fees, they must communicate these requirements to the responsible party and take steps to resolve any inaccuracy or conf ict. T ey document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes .</p><p>Summary: Behavior analysts use appropriate data collection procedures, and they graphically display, summarize, and use the data to make decisions about continuing, modifying, or terminating services. [See <ref type="bibr">Chapter 7.]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.02">Identifying Stakeholders</head><p>Behavior analysts identify stakeholders when providing services. When multiple stakeholders (e.g., parent or legally authorized representative, teacher, principal) are involved, the behavior analyst identifes their relative obligations to each stakeholder.

Behavior analysts provide the client and/or relevant stakeholders with a written plan for discontinuing services, document acknowledgment of the plan, review the plan throughout the discharge process, and document all steps taken. Summary : Tis section now includes a ffh reason for discontinuation, when "relevant stakeholders are not complying with the behavior-change intervention." Tis is a signif cant addition to the ethics code.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.16">Appropriately Transitioning Services</head><p>Behavior analysts include in their service agreement the circumstances for transitioning the client to another behavior analyst within or outside of their organization. T ey make appropriate eforts to efectively manage transitions; provide a written plan that includes target dates, transition activities, and responsible parties; and review the plan throughout the transition. When relevant, they take appropriate steps to minimize disruptions to services during the transition by collaborating with relevant service providers. Summary : Tis includes the circumstances for transitioning the client to another behavior analyst, including providing a written plan and transition activities; behavior analysts take steps to minimize disruptions during the transition. [See Chapter <ref type="bibr">8 .</ref>] T is appears to replace the previous statement about not abandoning clients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.05">Maintaining Supervision Documentation</head><p>Behavior analysts create, update, store, and dispose of documentation related to their supervisees or trainees by following all applicable requirements (e.g., BACB rules, licensure requirements, funder and organization policies), including those relating to conf dentiality. Tey ensure that their documentation, and the documentation of their supervisees or trainees, is accurate and complete. Tey maintain documentation in a manner that allows for the efective transition of supervisory oversight if necessary. Tey retain their supervision documentation for at least seven years and as otherwise required by law and other relevant parties and instruct their supervisees or trainees to do the same.</p><p>Summary: Behavior analysts are responsible for all documentation related to their supervisees. Documentation must be accurate and complete, must allow for transition, and must be kept for seven years. Supervisees must do the same. [See Chapter 9.]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.07">Incorporating and Addressing Diversity</head><p>During supervision and training, behavior analysts actively incorporate and address topics related to diversity (e.g., age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status).</p><p>Summary: It is necessary to include a wide variety of diversity topics in supervision and training. In the new code, many categories are listed, but the "topics" to be discussed are lef up to supervisors. [See Chapter 9.]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.11">Facilitating Continuity of Supervision</head><p>Behavior analysts minimize interruption or disruption of supervision and make appropriate and timely eforts to facilitate the continuation of supervision in the event of planned interruptions (e.g., temporary leave) or unplanned interruptions <ref type="bibr">(e.g., illness, emergencies)</ref>. When an interruption or disruption occurs, they communicate to all relevant parties the steps being taken to facilitate continuity of supervision.</p><p>Summary: BCBAs minimize interruption of supervision and make appropriate eforts to facilitate the continuation of supervision in the event of interruptions. If interruptions occur, steps should be taken to facilitate the continuity of supervision, and these steps are shared with relevant parties. [See Chapter 9.] 4.12 Appropriately Terminating Supervision When behavior analysts determine, for any reason, to terminate supervision or other services that include supervision, they work with all relevant parties to develop a plan for terminating supervision that minimizes negative impacts to the supervisee or trainee. Tey document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Summary: When supervision is terminated, behavior analysts work with all parties on a plan that minimizes negative impacts to the supervisee; all of these steps need to be documented. [See Chapter 9 .]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.01">Protecting Clients, Stakeholders</head><p>Behavior analysts take appropriate steps to protect the rights of their clients, stakeholders, supervisees, and trainees in all public statements. Behavior analysts prioritize the rights of their clients in all public statements.

If behavior analysts provide nonbehavioral services, those services must be clearly distinguished from their behavioral services and BACB certifcation with the following disclaimer: "Tese interventions are not behavioral in nature and are not covered by my BACB certif cation." T is disclaimer is placed alongside the names and descriptions of all nonbehavioral interventions. If a behavior analyst is employed by an organization that violates this Code standard, the behavior analyst makes reasonable eforts to remediate the situation, documenting all actions taken and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Summary: Behavior analysts do not advertise non-behavioral services as ABA. If they provide non-behavioral services, they must be clearly distinguished from ABA services and certif cation and must use a disclaimer to this efect. If your company does not make this distinction, you need to try and remediate the situation and document everything. [See Chapter 10.]</p></div>

Tese testimonials must be identif ed as solicited or unsolicited, include an accurate statement of the relationship between the behavior analyst and the testimonial author, and comply with all applicable privacy and conf dentiality laws. When soliciting testimonials from former clients or stakeholders, behavior analysts provide them with clear and thorough descriptions about where and how the testimonial will appear, make them aware of any risks associated with the disclosure of their private information, and inform them that they can rescind the testimonial at any time. If a behavior analyst is employed by an organization that violates this Code standard, the behavior analyst makes reasonable eforts to remediate the situation, documenting all actions taken and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Summary: When asking former clients for statements to use in advertisements to attract new clients, it is necessary to consider that they may re-enter services at a later time and that a disclaimer</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>Changes to the 2022 Ethics Code â¢ 25 all actions taken and the eventual outcomes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STILL NEEDS CLARIFICATION</head><p>New Code 1.14 Romantic and Sexual Relationships. T is code item still does not clarify the question about social relationships with former clients.

However, one cannot discuss their behavioral services or the behavior analyst's current clients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY</head><p>Tere were both signifcant and minor modifcations to the 2022 Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts. In addition to a major reorganization and reduction of the code categories from ten to six, there were 20 additions 2 and 17 deletions or "moved" changes. In the new Code, for the frst time, attention is drawn to cultural responsiveness and diversity. Behavior analysts are encouraged to be aware of their personal biases and to avoid entering into multiple relationships. Gifs of "gratitude" with a value up to $10 are not permitted, and clients and stakeholders should be made aware of this limitation at the beginning of the professional relationship. Behavior analysts should be timely in their work and administrative duties, and they should respond in a timely fashion to requests for information. With regard to programming, the new code addresses and further delineates requirements for data collection, discontinuing and transitioning services, and supervision. Finally, testimonials, advertising, and social media should be handled with care to protect the reputation of individual behavior analysts and our f eld.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>suddenly the rules are</head><p>From the time people are different.</p><p>young children, we can safely say that there is no consistent set of rules of ethical conduct for all citizens. If a junior high school student cheats on a test, gets an "A," and does not get caught, he may come to believe that cheating is okay regardless of what his parent or religious leader says. A pattern can develop where "Don't get caught" becomes the rule rather than "Don't cheat." A child who routinely fails to do her afer-school chores, makes excuses, and is forgiven may grow up to be an adult who learns to make up elaborate stories about why she was late to work or why her quarterly report was inaccurate and turned in 3 days past the deadline. Over time, the cumulative result of these childhood-throughadulthood experiences produces individuals with loosely formed rules, referred to as personal ethics. Cheating on one's spouse, lying about why you can't visit your elderly parents, and illegally using someone else's internet connection are all examples related to personal ethics. Tese personal ethics are ofen referred to as moral principles. Personal ethics can be contrasted with professional ethics. When students decide to enter a graduate program in behavior analysis, they are entering a world where suddenly the rules are diferent-and explicit. To understand the possible conf icts that budding professional behavior analysts face, consider the following comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAVORS</head><p>Friends and relatives ofen ask each other for favors. A favor might range from sharing a Netfix password, watching a friend's house while she is on vacation, to borrowing a lawn mower for a day or a truck for a weekend. Te longer the friendship, the more intimate or complex the favors can become. "Could you tell me the name of a good counselor? My partner and I are having some personal problems," or "If my wife asks, could you tell her I went bowling with you on Tursday night?" If a citizen who is accustomed to asking for and returning favors then begins receiving in-home services from a behavior analyst three times a week, it would not be unexpected to also ask the behavior analyst for favors. "Could you run the therapy session for Jason in the car today? I have to take my older son to soccer practice." Tis example might sound made up, but this happened to one of the frst author's master's students. Falling back on her own history of personal ethics-people do favors for each other-the student agreed to ride along and try to do language training in the back seat of the cluttered family minivan. Soon it became an everyday routine. Of course, the language training was totally inefective while weaving through fve o'clock trafc in the distracting backseat microenvironment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOSSIP</head><p>If you pause briefy at the checkout counter of any grocery store,</p><p>The general thinking you will fnd yourself encoun-seems to be that gossip tering gossip-and not just any is fun and entertaining, gossip, but juicy gossip, comso what is the harm? plete with in-depth, full-color, Photoshop-enhanced snapshots. Between magazines at the checkout counter and ubiquitous reality television shows, not only is gossip one of the recognized coins of the pop culture and commercial realm, but average citizens have come to accept it as normal. Te general thinking seems to be that gossip is fun and entertaining, so what is the harm? T is attitude is so pervasive that a person refusing to participate may be seen as peculiar.</p><p>In the professional setting, behavior analysts encounter daily temptations. Consultants frequently report that parents will ask about someone else's child. "How is Maggie doing? I heard she was ASD and having some problems," a parent of another child will ask, without realizing that we cannot talk about clients or their families or reveal confdential information. To the person who wants to inquire about a client, the request seems harmless. Rather than consider the information "confdential," the person wanting to get the scoop on someone else's child views the question as just a part of the daily harvesting of bite-sized nuggets of tasty information. Talking about other people like this is gossip.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"WHITE LIES"</head><p>To avoid conf ict or censure, it has become common in our culture for people to cover up their mistakes, motives, or personal shortcomings with "white lies." Rather than tell a friend she doesn't want to join her for cofee because she is gossipy, the sensitive person who wants to avoid confict will ofer up, "I'm so sorry, but I've got to go shopping for my niece's birthday party." And, of course, she will get caught. "Oh, that sounds like fun; can I join you?" Now the little-white-lying culprit will have to make additional, perhaps even more dramatic, excuses. "Well, actually, I have a lot of boxes in my car, since I have to drop of Sam's invites at Easy Mail before I go shopping." "Oh, I can help you with that," replies the doesn'ttake-a-hint friend. "We can take my new SUV; it has lots of room for boxes, and I can help you unload them." One theory says that because people so commonly use evasive tactics rather than telling the truth, they are always suspicious of other people's explanations. At the other extreme, there are also plenty of people who can't read your subtle signals and will try to help you overcome every lying excuse you can ofer. Behavior analysts cannot trafc in any of this deception. Following Code 1.01, they should always be truthful. Rather than responding with, "Oh, he's doing fne, Mr. Aslam," the truthful answer might be, "We are looking closely at the data from Daleel's behavior assessment, and we have some possible for goals for him. Is there a time that we could sit and discuss those?" ing the behavior analyst is the lifesaver who has transformed the child and given the parents hope, it seems only reasonable to give this valued person some tangible form of appreciation. T is might range from homemade cookies to lefover spaghetti ("It's my secret family recipe") or an invitation to go with the family to the beach for a weekend ("It will be fun; you can have fun with Damon and see what he is like when he sits and plays in the sand"). In the civilian world, people give gifs regularly, including cash for the doorman, hairdresser, and newspaper delivery person at Christmas or a bottle of wine for a friend who is having an open house. Wily clients have been known to do their own research to fnd out when their BCBA's birthday is and surprise the consultant with a gif that is sure to please. New York Yankees ball caps, Atlanta Braves baseball tickets, books, expensive wine, baby gifs, and $50 eGif cards are all reported presents given to behavior analysts by some of those who have attended our workshops (none of which is allowed under Code 1.12 since they exceed the $10 limit). Although permissible, even exchanging small gif s creates a dual relationship. Te client, stakeholder, and the behavior analyst now become friends, and the BCBA could be expected to return the favor at the right time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPRECIATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVICE</head><p>Citizens ask for and give advice to one another freely. T ey will recommend a movie, restaurant, babysitter, and maybe even a doctor without blinking. Teir advice is ofen based on personal experience, unspecif ed biases, and undisclosed relationships. "T ere is a new fooring outlet on West Broadway; I got a really good deal there." Full disclosure might reveal that the brother-in-law of the person who made the recommendation owns the store. Just as they will ask a friend or neighbor to recommend a school or a realtor, many people will ask their behavior analyst what he or she thinks is the best way to handle a smart-aleck teen or a lazy spouse.</p><p>Prior to their professional training, behavior analysts were once citizens who most likely asked for and gave advice on a variety of topics from what psychology course to take or where to apply for graduate school. However, once one becomes a Board Certif ed Behavior Analyst, the rules change considerably. As a professional, with a whole host of professional ethics to absorb and live by, the BCBA must be careful about how and what is said to others when it comes to giving advice.</p><p>A teacher has gotten to know the behavior analyst who visits her classroom twice a week to check on Janie's progress. In the middle of a conversation about Janie's data, the teacher says, "What do you think I should do with Nunzio? You've seen him act out. I think he's got a behavior disorder or a mental problem. What do you think?" Having one's behavior guided by a professional code of ethics is a whole new experience for many behavior analysts. While there may be a tendency to give a quick and clever retort or to toss of one-liners, the correct response is, "I'm sorry; I can't comment. He's not my client and discussing his behavior would be a violation of privacy and confdentiality in any event" (BACB Code 2.03).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESPONSIBILITY</head><p>Passing the buck when something goes wrong, staging cover-ups to avoid embarrassment, and concealing evidence of incompetence have become national pastimes among our political leaders, movie stars, and sports personalities. Te average person gets desensitized, and unethical behavior seeps into the general population to the point that admitting error and confessing to it have become a lost art. Te parents who do not take responsibility for their child's school vandalism ofen deny their failure to supervise efectively. Some parents go so far as to provide an alibi or excuse for the child's behavior ("He couldn't help it. He has been so sick, and his father had a drinking problem."). Such actions teach children an interesting set of rules: if negative consequences are prevented, both parties are reinforced for tactics to avoid responsibility. Behavior analysts must be aware of the possibility that there are indeed clients who have histories like this and take the necessary steps to ensure that agreements with parents are followed through. Tis is especially the case with parent-administered consequences in the home (e.g., good-behavior plans) where the child is earning points or privileges for reinforcers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY</head><p>When it comes to ethics, behavior analysts must make the diffcult but important transition from "private citizen" to behavior analysis professional. If standards from one's pre-ABA life are at cross-purposes with what is expected of a BCBA, they must be abandoned and replaced with our feld's rather strict Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts. Furthermore, almost daily, the BCBA will contact clients, trainees, and other professionals from other specialties who will engage in "unethical" behaviors, possibly tempting them or even mocking them for their strait-laced approach.</p><p>Te potential confict of a history of personal ethics versus newly learned professional ethics and our ethics code is a worthy challenge for our feld and one that is worth engaging in for the benefts and integrity that it will bring to our profession.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Understanding the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Core Principles and Distinction of Client Versus Stakeholder</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CORE PRINCIPLES</head><p>Four foundational principles, which all behavior analysts should strive to embody, serve as the framework for the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts. Behavior analysts should use these principles to interpret and apply the standards in the code. Te four core principles that should guide behavior analysts are to benef t others; treat others with compassion, dignity, and respect; behave with integrity; and ensure their own competence.</p><p>(1) Benef t Others. Behavior analysts work to maximize benef ts and do no harm by: (a) Protecting the welfare and rights of clients above all others.</p><p>Te best way to maximize benefts to clients is to understand what their needs are and then to formulate an ef ective plan to meet these needs. Since we are behavior analysts, our focus would generally be on the behavioral needs of clients (i.e., what behaviors are standing in the way of optimizing the reinforcers available in the client's environment). T is might include inappropriate social behaviors which are ofputting to others, such as dwelling on unusual or unpleasant topics. Other inappropriate social behaviors include frequent references to obscure factoids (e.g., "Did you know that dinosaurs were cold blooded?") or focusing conversations on themselves and not asking about others in the group. As behavior analysts, we also must be sensitive to the environment in which the clients reside. In some cases, to protect the welfare of the client, this may mean contacting a social welfare agency on their behalf or fling a report with Child Protective Services if the client is at risk of harm. (b) Protecting the welfare and rights of other individuals with whom they interact in a professional capacity. T ese "other individuals" might include employees, colleagues, students, supervisees, or trainees you encounter on a regular basis at work. We are ofen so focused on clients that we miss cues that other people around us are in pain. A graduate student trainee may appear unusually upset during supervision, for example. A sof inquiry such as, "Are you okay? Can I help you with anything?" might reveal that an ex-boyfriend is now stalking her. With your experience and connections, you may be able to direct her to an ofcer at the sherif's department that can provide some assistance. Another less serious example might be a new BCBA fresh out of graduate school who needs mentoring on how to negotiate the bureaucracy for getting permission to go to a conference or to be reimbursed for travel. (c) Focusing on the short-and long-term efects of their professional activities. Tere may be a tendency in our f eld to focus on short-term changes in behavior. While shortterm changes are benefcial, if we focus solely on short-term changes, we may miss the big picture of important longterm outcomes for our clients. By only paying attention to teaching an elderly resident to participate in social activities that are ofered in the dining room, we are likely to miss the meaningful long-term goal of teaching her to use an iPad to connect with her grandchildren via Zoom. T e long-term goal might result in grandchildren visiting more ofen and a quality of life improvement.</p><p>(d) Actively identifying and addressing the potential negative impacts of their own physical and mental health on their professional activities. For some behavior analysts, the stress of managing a large caseload or running the business as both BCBA and CEO are just too much. These overworked and overstressed professionals might seek relief in the form of alcohol or drugs or both. Addictions usually begin with minor habit changes undetectable to them or to their colleagues. Over time, addictions can build to the point where there is actual potential harm to others, including clients. Mental health issues such as mood, depressive, or eating disorders have a similar arc, where they creep up over time and then lead to an inability to function. For the person who is struggling with an addiction, contacting a professional who can help may be too difficult. Help from colleagues is often necessary for the person to seek help. (e) Actively identifying potential and actual conficts of interest and working to resolve them in a manner that avoids or minimizes harm.</p><p>A confict of interest in our feld could involve a behavior analyst pressuring a client to begin services with a provider who is a relative. Another example would be the behavior analyst getting into a situation where he or she has a concealed commercial interest. Recent examples of such a conf ict involve an agency that decided to ofer diagnostic assessments for children "for free." Ten, when a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was made, there was an immediate of er for the family to receive services at the same agency. Another confict of interest involved an ABA faculty member who opened a private of-campus clinic. Te faculty member then persuaded their university to send the students to work at the clinic for their supervision hours. Te students were charged $85 per hour for supervision. Te students complained that they had no choice of where to earn their hours and pointed out the new BMW convertible the "professor" was parking in a designated spot in front of the clinic. (f) Actively identifying and addressing factors <ref type="bibr">(e.g., personal, fnancial, institutional, political, religious, cultural)</ref> that might lead to conficts of interest, misuse of their position, or negative impacts on their professional activities.</p><p>Te professor in the above example justifed his new business model as appropriate since the university did not pay well, and the president did not seem to appreciate the work involved in creating an ABA master's program. He felt totally justifed in reaping some reward for his eforts, especially when he learned that the starting salaries of graduates of "his" program were 20% higher than his 9-month salary. T e professor was incapable of identifying any of his actions as improper. (g) Efectively and respectfully collaborating with others in the best interest of those with whom they work and always placing clients' interests f rst.</p><p>Tere is increasing interest in our feld in reaching out to adjoining colleagues who may have treatments to ofer our clients that are necessary for their success. For example, speech and language pathologists (SLPs) may have a great deal to ofer in terms of treating articulation and phonological disorders. T ese problems are beyond the scope of competence of a behavior analyst who takes a strict operant verbal behavior approach. SLPs use evidence-based procedures, which are compatible with our need to approach problems from a scientifc point of view. We need to remain skeptical of professionals who have fundamentally diferent approaches of a pseudoscientif c nature.</p><p>( As behavior analysts, we are required to follow the law and educate all behavioral staf about the requirements as well as the consequences for violating this law. In addition, stakeholders, behavioral staf, and other employees have a right to privacy and confdentiality of their personal information.</p><p>A new RBT who confded to the HR director that they were transgender was appalled when this was mentioned to their BCBA supervisor who then brought it up at a staf meeting. "So, Taylor, I guess you would probably want to be assigned to our gay families, is that right?" (c) Respecting and actively promoting clients' self-determination to the best of their abilities, particularly when providing services to vulnerable populations. "Self-determination" is another term for autonomy. Self-determination means that to the extent possible, vulnerable clients (who are otherwise largely defenseless) are still given every opportunity to acquire skills that allow them to manipulate their environment and deliver their own reinforcers. Mobility devices and language-assistive equipment are useful tools along with teaching clients to operate this technology so they can travel where they wish and communicate their needs. Tis core principle should always guide the development of goals and objectives for our clients. One good example of this is teaching older clients how to assemble products that can be sold commercially. Tis would provide a source of income that clients can spend as they wish. (d) Acknowledging that personal choice in service delivery is important by providing clients and stakeholders with needed information to make informed choices about services. Up until recently, clients had little choice in the mode of service delivery. Once clients were signed up for services, they were given a schedule and were expected to drop of their child at the appointed time. However, there are currently other options available for how clients can receive services; some of these include in-home ABA and remote or telehealth service delivery systems. Technology may soon present additional options via artifcial intelligence, which could deliver a virtual therapist right to a client on demand. T is would be similar to the way in which Alexa can instantly deliver requested news, music, mood lighting, and weather forecasts. Clients and stakeholders should be able to choose to receive information and documentation about behavior programming status and progress verbally, through instant messaging, email, or by other means.</p><p>(3) Behave With Integrity. Behavior analysts fulf ll responsibilities to their scientifc and professional communities, to society in general, and to the communities they serve by: (a) Behaving in an honest and trustworthy manner. A good test of an honest and trustworthy person is that you can reveal a secret to them and know that it will never pass their lips. Another test: Would you trust this person to watch af er your children or take care of your elderly parents? Tis is the standard that we hold for our behavior analysts. We expect them to be honest and trustworthy in assessing their clients' needs and abilities, in taking reliable data, in preparing accurate reports, and ultimately in discontinuing services in an hon- Tis is fraudulent billing. RBTs will ofen complain that their BCBA supervisor has them writing behavior programs for which the BCBA takes credit. RBTs have also reported that they have been assigned to walk the BCBA's dog or trek to the deli and bring them lunch (both billed as RBT time). T ese examples of misrepresentation show that the BCBA has no integrity and probably is not to be trusted. (c) Following through on obligations. Almost the entire daily calendar of a BCBA consists of obligations from meeting with potential clients, assessing and training RBTs, preparing progress and discharge reports, and more-much more. An obligation is an agreement. In some cases, it is a moral requirement that must be fulflled. In therapy settings, obligations are usually written into a contract that a behavior analyst signs and agrees to perform certain activities. T ese contracts are usually legally binding. In agreeing to watch out for their clients' best interest, a BCBA has an obligation to provide seamless service delivery, including not suddenly leaving the job with no notice.</p><p>(d) Holding themselves accountable for their work and the work of their supervisees and trainees, and correcting errors in a timely manner. A person with integrity takes responsibility for their work and accepts the consequences, both positive and negative, for doing so. In the case of BCBA supervisors, they take full responsibility for the professional activities of their supervisees. Tis includes the way that supervisees or trainees treat clients, keep track of their hours, maintain their data, conduct themselves with caregivers and stakeholders, and communicate publicly on websites. Tis is a huge responsibility. If errors come out of any of these activities, they must be corrected quickly. (e) Being knowledgeable about and upholding BACB and other regulatory requirements. BCBAs must be familiar with all Board regulations involving certifcation, continuing education, recertifcation, and more. Tey must also be familiar with any regulations pertaining to service delivery related to Medicaid, Tricare, or insurance companies and the billing codes that are relevant. Ignorance is no excuse when it comes to regulations. (f) Actively working to create professional environments that uphold the core principles and standards of the code. All behavior analysts should model professional ethical conduct in the workplace and prompt and reinforce others for doing the same. Creating an ethical environment works to promote high standards and best practices so that everyone can be trusted and there are no "ethical slackers." (g) Respectfully educating others about the ethics requirements of behavior analysts and the mechanisms for addressing professional misconduct. Te "others" here would include client families, stakeholders, and teachers as well as non-behavioral colleagues. Helping others understand our strict ethics standards and the reasoning behind them can increase the acceptance of behavior analysis as a profession.</p><p>(4) Ensure T eir Competence. Behavior analysts ensure their competence by: (a) Remaining within the profession's scope of practice. A "competent" professional is one who can perform complex behavioral tasks consistently and efciently with positive outcomes.</p><p>Stepping beyond the boundaries of our behavior-analysis scope of practice (i.e., beyond the Task List) is a certain prescription for less than competent professional performance.  <ref type="bibr">(d)</ref> Being aware of, working within, and continually evaluating the boundaries of their competence. Te best ways to remain aware of your areas of competence is to seek feedback from peers in your professional practice on a regular basis and to interact with experts in your area of competence via conference presentations, workshops, interactive videos, and webinars. Visiting clinics that specialize in your area of competence and observing and interacting with the professionals at the clinics is a great way to build your prof ciency and expand your knowledge. (e) Working to continually increase their knowledge and skills related to cultural responsiveness and service delivery to diverse groups. Cultural responsiveness is "the ability to learn from and relate respectfully with people of your own culture as well as those from other cultures." 1 Tis may mean making "cultural adaptations" of our evidence-based treatments for diverse populations, including understanding how norms are established, goals are set, contingencies are understood, and efective reinforcers are determined and delivered in each culture that the behavior analyst encounters. How the client family is approached may vary from culture to culture, and the behavior analyst needs to be prepared to adapt to their preferences starting with the f rst meeting. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISTINCTION OF CLIENT VERSUS STAKEHOLDER 3</head><p>In the 2022 Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts, two terms occur with great frequency. Tese terms involve distinctions that are important to acknowledge: client and "stakeholder." In the general culture, the latter term is a metaphor for someone who has a stake in a game of chance: they have money on the line and an interest in the outcome of each hand that is played. Heretofore, the focus of most behavior analysts has been directly on the client's needs and the interests of the proximal caregiver who would be involved in treatment decisions and/or actual delivery of the treatment itself. With this shif to an emphasis on a wider circle of individuals who may have some "stake" in the behavior-change enterprise, the importance of involving the other players comes into focus. A grandparent or sibling might be a stakeholder or possibly a neighbor who babysits for the family when the children arrive home from school. Some of the stakeholders may have a more peripheral interest, such as a funding agency that is paying for services.</p><p>Here are the defnitions of client and stakeholder as they relate to behavior analysis:</p><p>"Client : Te direct recipient of the behavior analyst's services. At various times during service provision, one or more stakeholders may simultaneously meet the defnition of client (e.g., the point at which they receive direct training or consultation). In some contexts, the client might be a group of individuals (e.g., with organizational behavior management services)." "Stakeholder: An individual, other than the client, who is impacted by and invested in the behavior analyst's services (e.g., parent, caregiver, relative, legally authorized representative, collaborator, employer, agency or institutional representative, licensure board, funder, third-party contractor for services)."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical Decision-Making</head><p>Simple Ethical Questions Versus Complex Ethical Dilemmas P rofessional behavior analysts must be profcient on all the many skills on the task lists related to the profession. Ethics is an area for which Board Certif ed Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), Board Certifed Assistant Behavior Analysts (BCaBAs), and Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) have ongoing questions long afer their initial certifcation training. Te assortment of the ethics problems in daily practice spans a wide range of situations. Just when you think you've heard it all, a behavior analyst is confronted with a completely new variation of related to an ethical issue. On a regular basis, supervisors, advisors, faculty members, and Ethics Hotline experts address ethics problems that range from simple to complex ethical dilemmas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIMPLE ETHICAL QUESTIONS</head><p>Some ethical situations encountered by behavior analysts involve relatively simple ethical questions. For many of these questions, a straightforward yes or no answer is suf cient.</p><p>â¢ "Is it ethical for a BCBA to take data on my child at school without my permission?"</p><p>â¢ "Should my supervisor get credit for observing me when she never looked up once from her iPad during my discrete trial training session?" â¢ "Te BCBA supervisor for my in-home consultation immediately put a punishment procedure in place. He never even considered other less restrictive options. Is this acceptable?" â¢ "My cousin is an RBT. She knows Aaron well and they really get along. Can she be assigned to Aaron's case?" â¢ "My daughter, Sophia, has a diagnosed eating disorder. T e behavior therapist is working on this problem, but it is clear she does not know what she is doing. Sophia is gagging and coughing during the whole session. Should the behavior analyst be working on this?" â¢ "I just saw a photo on Facebook of my RBT. In the photo, she and my son were both grinning ear to ear. I never gave permission for this. Is a program allowed to post photos of clients?" â¢ "I just noticed last month's invoice for my child's behavioral services. I was billed for 3 days of ABA treatment when we were not even in town! I then went and checked invoices from other months, and this is not the frst time this has happened. Should I report this?" It does not take a complex algorithm to answer questions such as these. Our code is clear regarding the answers to these simple questions, and it is just a matter of bringing the specif c standard to the attention of someone in charge. Usually, no one needs to be reported to the Board and most ofen, a solution only requires one meeting with the right person. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.1 illustrates the decisionmaking fowchart for these types of simple, straightforward ethics questions. Some tips for conducting the meeting: Bring a notepad so you can take notes. Be calm, introduce yourself and hand over your business card. Have all your documentation in hand and don't just complain, but suggest a solution in a straightforward manner. Ten, making good eye contact, ask for a response: "What do you think? Can we do this . . .?" Verbally summarize the meeting at the end; if the person agrees with your solution, ask for a date of completion. Before you leave, ask for a business card. When you get home, send the person an email with bullet points that were covered and a summary statement at the end of what you believe was accomplished (this is the paper trail that you are creating around this problem and the solution). Include the expected date of completion in the email. Tank the person for listening and helping you solve this problem. If the problem is in fact solved by the date agreed upon, f nd out who the person's boss/supervisor is and contact them and let them know how much you appreciate the help of this person, indicate that they are lucky to have such a smart, competent, honest, ethical person on board, and so forth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMPLEX ETHICAL DILEMMAS</head><p>Some of the problems that confront clients, stakeholders, and others are far more complex. Tey may evolve over time from a minor irritation into a full-blown war of words. Tere might be a victim and an oppressor, and the client or supervisee wants a hef y consequence for the alleged instigator. Here is an example of a complex case: 1 A BCBA started providing services, without an agreement, for our special-needs daughter. Te services were arranged by my husband and the BCBA. Our daughter is on the autism spectrum, and she has received ABA therapy through a legitimate agency for three years. Soon af er the BCBA reached out to my husband to advise him regarding our daughter's individualized education plan (IEP) and other therapists' evaluations, my husband and the BCBA began having an afair. My husband and I are now getting divorced. Te BCBA is still very involved in reviewing my daughter's evaluations from her special needs providers. T e BCBA is encouraging my soon-to-be-ex-husband to oppose me (I am this child's mother!) and build a case to reduce my daughter's special needs therapies. It's almost as if she used her background with special needs children to seduce him. I don't know if this is a breach of the code of ethics or not.</p><p>The 11-step flowchart for complex ethical dilemmas shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.2 can be used for complex ethics questions such as this one.</p><p>By going through the steps of the fowchart, you can see information you would need and the decisions you would have to make if you were the mother in the case above.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE SEVENïºSTEP MODEL FOR ANALYZING COMPLEX CASES</head><p>Complex ethics cases require special consideration by behavior analysts. When complex cases arise, a close and thorough analysis is needed so that clients are not harmed and the behavior analyst does not sufer in the process. Te real-life case here, submitted by a BCaBA, represents a situation that falls into the moderately complex category.</p><p>"I'm a BCaBA behavior therapist with 1 1/2 years' experience. I work at a small private, for-prof t school that provides educational services to children with developmental disabilities. Tis situation involves several of the children ages 5 to 7 years old. I am assigned to do 1:1 therapy with children on the autism spectrum. One day, an additional child was brought to me since one of the other therapists was out sick. I was not given a curriculum sheet or any instructions about the child. I was told, 'Tis is just for today, make it work,' which I did. But as a result, my primary student and I got nothing accomplished since it was all I could do to manage the second child. T e next day I was told the same thing, 'Make it work, this is just temporary.' Again, I got very little accomplished. Tis went on for the rest of the week. Essentially, I was just babysitting these two children. Te parents of the primary child stopped me on Friday when they picked him up and reported that their child seemed restless and less verbal all week. Tey wanted to know if I knew of any problems. I lied and said that sometimes it goes like that, ups and downs, good weeks, and bad weeks; they accepted my word and lef. I felt horrible afer this. I then went to the owner (who is a BCBA) and said I didn't feel comfortable with this situation. I probably shouldn't have asked, but I said, 'Are we still billing as though the children are getting one-to-one?' Te owner said, 'Tat's a business matter, just stick to the therapy, it will work out okay.' 'What about the parents? Do they know?' I asked. Te owner just stared at me and then walked away. I have the strong suspicion that the school is billing for one-on-one therapy for each child and that they have not told the parents or the insurance company of the new arrangement. What should I do? Go to the business manager? Tell the parents? Two very good BCBA's that I liked and trusted lef this school 6 months earlier. One was the clinical director, and a very ethical person. I asked the owner why he lef and was told, 'It's just a professional diference of opinion. Now I think I know why they lef .'" It seems that cases like this are cropping up across the country as agencies scramble with long waiting lists, too few qualif ed staf , and too much revenue at stake. Seemingly invisible decisions, such as doubling up on clients but billing for one-on-one therapy, reap great benefts and go unnoticed by nearly everyone except for the sensitive and ethical behavior analyst.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Is the Incident Covered by the Ethics Code?</head><p>Before you dive too deeply into the solution to a possible ethics problem, it is best to begin by making sure the problem is covered by the code. Tis can be done by going to www.BACB.com and clicking on "Ethics" on the top navigation bar. Te Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts has a convenient one-page table of contents where you can skim the titles and look for key words related to your dilemma. You can also scan the index at the back of this book.</p><p>For this case, two Core Principles and several stan-Do you have the strength dards of the code are relevant. to take on the organization, Being Truthful (1.01) on the the skill to deal with the part of the BCBA/owner is a other individuals involved, good place to start; additionand the motivation to do ally, Responsibility in Practice Codes 2.01, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, the right thing? and 2.09 may have been violated. Having established that there are serious violations of the code involved and that you have a basis for moving forward, the next step is to understand the people with whom you will be dealing (i.e., the stakeholders).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Stakeholders: (A) the BCBA (or BCaBA or RBT); (B) the Client; (C) the Supervisor; (D) the Agency Head; and (E) Other Organizations</head><p>Chief among the stakeholders is you, the person who will be organizing this efort to decide and take steps to correct a situation that has been deemed unethical based on information obtained in</p><p>Step 1. Te next person to consider is the client. Making decisions regarding clients requires careful thinking on the part of the behavior analyst. Te client is of en a vulnerable individual who needs protection and would beneft the most from the correction of the situation (see Glossary for the broader defnition of client).</p><p>In this example, the most immediate client was the original child who was on the autism spectrum. Tere was at least one more client in this case, and that was the second child. Te second child was only receiving "babysitting" services rather than language and social skills training, which the school contracted to provide. Another stakeholder in this case was the family of the original child. Te family believed the child was receiving one-on-one language and social skills training. In a broader sense, the insurance company that was largely paying for this therapeutic treatment could be considered a stakeholder as well. Finally, from the perspective of the owner, the private school that hired the BCaBA was also technically considered a client in this scenario. While most of the stakeholders (including the behavior analyst, the f rst child, the second child, the parents, and the insurance company) were aligned in their interests, the owner had conficting interests, such as keeping costs down and maintaining or increasing margins.</p><p>Te BCaBA did not refer to a supervisor in the case, so we assume that this person was either absent (e.g., the BCBA/owner did the supervising) or unresponsive. In most cases, behavior analysts will take cases such as this directly to their supervisors. Supervisors in behavioral settings should have the welfare of clients in mind and should be allies in solving the ethical problem.</p><p>Te BCBA/owner in this case was a stakeholder in the sense that the behavior analyst had to deal with her to solve the ethics problem. In this case, it sounded as though the owner had not planned for emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, such as a therapist being out due to illness. Further, the owner was not prepared to be upstanding on the billing with either the parents or the insurance company. She was a cunning adversary whose behavior might be difcult to change. Unfortunately, there are behavior analysis/business owners in other companies who engage in similar practices. T e fnal stakeholder in this scenario was the insurance company. Te insurance company was an outside agency that was unknowingly taking a hit regarding billing. In cases such as this A contingency plan is a one, insurance companies should thoughtful and strategic be interested in rectifying the analysis of what to do in situation, although such reports the event that your first may be seen as "small potatoes" action was unsuccessful.</p><p>to them. Nonetheless, it would be unethical not to inform them of the breach of contract that exists with the families and the private school.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Contingency Plans for Ethics: Plan A, Plan B, Plan C</head><p>Te concept behind this step is the possibility that your f rst attempt to deal with an ethics dilemma in your job may not prove successful. In this case, for example, the BCaBA spoke f rst directly with the owner and did not really have a plan in mind. She probably thought the owner would say, "Oh, my, has it been that long? I need to get right on that, thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'm going to talk to the parents right now." Of course, that didn't happen, and for that very reason, in complex situations such as this, we recommend having a contingency plan in place from the beginning. A contingency plan is a thoughtful and strategic analysis of what to do in the event that your f rst action was unsuccessful. In the case above, when Plan A (talking to the owner) failed, the BCaBA did not have a backup strategy.</p><p>A possible Plan B would have been to explain the situation directly to the parents, who had already expressed concern about their child's treatment. An option such as this is always risky to the behavior analyst since it goes directly against what she was told, which was essentially to babysit two clients and keep quiet. If the BCaBA talked to the parents, she could have been f red immediately for insubordination. Tis is not uncommon when dealing with ethics; doing the right thing can have negative consequences for the ethics-minded person. It is possible if the BCaBA had told the parents what was happening, they would have expressed support for the behavior analyst and advocated for her with the owner. However, this is a big unknown. Sometimes parents have a special relationship with the owner and are unwilling to stand up for the right thing. In some situations, there are other contingencies, such as both parents have jobs and don't want an interruption in services because they would then have no childcare in place. In other instances, the parents' desire to do whatever it takes to support their child takes precedence. Whatever parents decide, when an ethical problem is called to their attention, they need to make some ethical decisions themselves. For example, they need to weigh being seen as troublesome parents versus leaving the school and enrolling their child somewhere else.</p><p>Obviously, for every ethics dilemma, the contingency plans will be dif erent. Te contingency plans should refect the unique circumstances of the case.</p><p>Tere should be a method To have a robust, responsible, to proceed from the least and respectable profession, to most intrusive interventions. Another factor that we must be aware of the needs to be considered is conduct of other behavior the problem-solving reperanalysts and be prepared to toire of the behavior analyst stand up for our clients' right and the "clout" that the perto effective treatment.</p><p>son has to make things happen in the organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Skills and Clout</head><p>Most behavior analysts entered this profession because of a strong desire to help people. For the most part, they were unaware that taking on responsibility for monitoring and maintaining ethical standards was a part of the package. But it is clear from the code this expectation is real. To have a robust, responsible, and respectable profession, we must be aware of the conduct of other behavior analysts and be prepared to stand up for our clients' right to ef ective treatment (2.01) and all other rights.</p><p>Te skills referred to in this step are described in 25 Essential Skills for the Successful Behavior Analyst: From grad school to the C-suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bailey &amp; Burch, 2022)</ref>. Te skills that are most relevant for this step include:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">â¢ Assertiveness â¢ Interpersonal communications â¢ Leadership â¢ Client advocate â¢ Critical thinking â¢ "T ink function" â¢ Using shaping ef ectively â¢ Handling dif cult people â¢ Performance management.</formula><p>Other skills that are not included but are very important in dealing with ethics cases are a basic understanding of (1) the law and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) how business and government agencies function.</p><p>Te "clout" factor in Step 4 refers to the infuence of position, power, and authority to make things happen. In this case, the BCaBA probably had little clout because of her short tenure with the school and her status as an assistant behavior analyst. If she were connected somehow (e.g., one of her parents or a relative worked The "clout" factor refers at the Department of Insurance Regulation or for a major insur-to the influence of position, ance carrier), she would have power, and authority to some borrowed clout that could make things happen. make a diference for an ethics case like this one.</p><p>Plan A Skills and Clout . Recall that the "plan" was to persuade the owner to inform parents about the situation, tell the truth about the status of their child's educational plan, beg for their understanding, and remedy the situation quickly. Te BCaBA in this case operated on the spur of the moment and was not prepared to be persuasive. Some recommended skills for her Plan A include assertiveness, good interpersonal communications, leadership, and handling difcult people. Showing leadership, presenting a strong case, and being prepared for pushback from the owner might have made a dif erence.</p><p>Plan B Skills and Clout. Plan B is to consider going directly to the parents. Tis would also involve good interpersonal communications skills, showing leadership, and assertiveness. In addition, in a case such as the sample case, the behavior analyst should consider "Tink Function" when addressing the parents (i.e., understanding where they are coming from in terms of the treatment of their child). Despite the breakdown in services, the parents may not have other options, may not want to ofend the owner, or may come on too strong when approaching the owner.</p><p>Plan C Skills and Clout . If the parents are not interested in dealing with the owner when told the child is not receiving services and there may have been inappropriate billing, the behavior analyst will have to operate like an advocate and decide if pushing the matter further is a good course of action. One option is for the behavior analyst to simply resign from the job and move on. Currently, there are many jobs for behavior analysts, and there is surely one that is more pro-ethics in its dealing with clients and their families (see Chapter 14 for what to look for when selecting a job). Another option is to report the fraud by the owner to the insurance company or the state insurance commissioner. Tis ups the ante quite a bit, and it will take some digging to understand how to do this, who to talk to, and what types of documentation are required. To proceed with this option, the behavior analyst may need to brush up on the law and do some research on insurance fraud.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">The Risk: (A) to the Client, (B) to Stakeholders, (C) to the Behavior Analyst</head><p>Te risk to the client, which includes the ASD child and his family, under Plan B is that the school may terminate them as "troublemakers." Depending on where they live, it might be dif cult to fnd another placement. Or, if they do fnd one, the location might be inconvenient.</p><p>In the example (which was a real case submitted by a BCaBA), the behavior analyst was not fred for bringing up the issue to the owner. However, if she pushed Plan B, she could have found herself without a job for being insubordinate. Tis behavior analyst was a clear risk to the owner and the school, since she could have spread the word that the owner was engaging in unethical conduct.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">The Implementation</head><p>Plan A (which was to talk to the owner) in this case basically failed. Te next step would be for the behavior analyst to think carefully about Plan B (which was going directly to the parents). In your own job, if you fnd yourself in a situation where you must decide if you should contact the parents of a client, there are some things to think about, including the time and place to meet with the parents and how to best present your case. It might not be best, for obvious reasons, to meet the parents in the lobby where they pick up their child each afernoon. You would not want to risk a dramatic scene if the owner saw you. Further, if the parents were in a rush at that time of day, you would not be able to deliver your message ef ectively. If you decide that contacting the child's parents is the way you need to proceed, ask the parents if there is a good time to meet for a few minutes. Te parents will likely want to know what this is about, and the best advice is to simply say something like, "I have something to discuss that is fairly important to me." Te idea is to not tip In any contentious arena, there is always the possibility that someone will decide to take legal action. If you are the target and you find yourself being sued, you should be prepared with detailed notes on what you did and when you did it.</p><p>your hand until you get to the meeting. Meeting away from the school in a quiet place is the best idea. Without being emotional, start with a statement of concern about the child and the lack of progress. Ten describe clearly what transpired and the owner's response, and simply wait for the parents' response. Af er that, just be supportive. Request the parents to leave your name out of this if they decide to act.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">The Evaluation</head><p>As with any task that one does only occasionally, it is a good idea to keep track of what was done and how the incident turned out. Tis is especially important in the case of our ef orts to monitor and maintain the ethical standards of our feld. In any contentious arena, there is always the possibility that someone will decide to take legal action. If you are the target and you fnd yourself being sued, you should be prepared with detailed notes on what you did and when you did it. Having contemporaneous records of meetings, phone calls, memos, and email will show an attorney, judge, or jury that you were operating in good faith to protect others from harm and are prepared to defend your actions.</p><p>Keeping detailed notes on each ethics case you confront will also help you determine what to do the next time an issue comes up. It is neither safe nor smart to count on your memory for reporting what happened a year ago when you were asked to falsify a record or when you, as a mandated reporter, had to report a childcare worker for abuse or neglect.</p></div>

Our feld has a relatively short history, going back only to the mid-1960s, and our roots are f rmly planted in the experimental analysis of behavior. T e original behavior analysts were ofen experimental psychologists who recognized how procedures originally developed in the animal lab could be applied to help the human condition. Te earliest applications with humans were almost direct replications of experimental (animal laboratory) methods. Tese procedures were used with populations that were abandoned by the other service professionals at the time. Te 1960s was also a time in which questions about the ethics of treatment were not raised. Well-trained, responsible, experimental psychologists used their own conscience, common sense, and respect for human values to create new treatments. With learning theory as a foundation, it was believed that these treatments might work to relieve With learning theory as a foundation, it was believed that these treatments might work to relieve suffering or dramatically improve the quality of life for institutionalized individuals who were not receiving any other forms of effective treatment.</p><p>sufering or dramatically improve the quality of life for institutionalized individuals who were not receiving any other forms of ef ective treatment. Tere was no Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts, and there was no oversight of the PhD researchers turned cuttingedge therapists. Teir work was done in the public eye with the full knowledge of parents or guardians, and a review of the work today would fnd little to fault in terms of ethical conduct. It was only much later that some poorly prepared and insensitive behavior analysts with serious ethics defciencies would create the scandals described in Chapter 1 .</p><p>Relative to other professions, behavior analysis is the new kid on the block. Physical therapy is said to have begun as a profession in Sweden in 1813, occupational therapy in 1921, and speech pathology in 1926. Our history as a feld of applied research can be dated to 1959 with the seminal research of Dr. Ted Ayllon and Dr. Jack Michael's "Te Psychiatric Nurse as a Behavioral Engineer" <ref type="bibr">(Ayllon &amp; Michael, 1959)</ref>. Tis work, carried out in Saskatchewan, Canada, was the beginning of our f eld. We received our current moniker, "applied behavior analysis" ("behavior analysis," for short) in 1968 with the publication of Don Baer, Mont Wolf, and Todd Risley's foundational paper, "Some Current Dimensions of Applied Behavior Analysis" <ref type="bibr">(Baer, Wolf, &amp; Risley, 1968)</ref>. T irty years later, in 1999, we coalesced as a profession when the Behavior Analyst Certifcation Board was formed by Jerry Shook and Michael Hemingway. T e frst code of ethics for behavior analysts was the Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts; this groundbreaking work was published in August 2014. Over the years there have been updates to the code, including a new name (Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts).</p><p>Te current set of ethics standards follows the routine established by the BACB for there to be a review of the ethics code every f ve years. Tis review includes input from the profession. In 2020-2021, Dr. Tyra Sellers and a committee of behavior analysts updated the code, and the result was that the BACB Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts was reorganized into six sections (from the previous ten).</p><p>Section 1 â¢ 71 Overall, the new code is prescriptive in nature. Rather than focus on violations (i.e., what not to do), the code now describes the best ethical practices suited for a changing society. Te code ref ects positive aspirations and high expectations for professionals who are quite young (50% of our BCBAs have been in the f eld fve years or less) but who represent the future of this dynamic and rapidly expanding discipline. Tis code is designed to educate young behavior analysts about their ethical responsibilities by spelling out in detail what it is to be a professional in the human services in the 21st century. Our great strength as a feld is our unwavering commitment to the science of behavior as envisioned by B. F. Skinner in his land-This code is designed to mark work, Science and Human</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>educate young behavior</head><p>Behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">( Skinner, 1953 )</ref> Being Truthful is a given for any behavior analyst. We could not exist as an evidence-based profession without this building block of trust in our word. Further, we are obligated to promote this intrinsic value with colleagues and students. Conforming with Legal and Professional Requirements is another given for any f eld that expects to have the trust of consumers and funding agencies. Te code also has an emphasis on Accountability for our actions and keeping commitments to employers as well as clients and stakeholders. As a profession matures, the boundaries become increasingly clear. Practicing within a Def ned Role and within their Scope of Competence is essential for behavior analysts to be able to be fully responsible for the implementation of behavioral technology. Te ability to deliver behavior change reliably and efectively over time requires Maintaining Competence , which does not come automatically but requires time, study, and ef ort to acquire those skills necessary to perform at the highest levels.</p><p>Although not new to other professions, there is a new emphasis in the code on engaging in Cultural Responsiveness and Diversity. Tis is an essential requirement to serve our varied populations, and it ties in closely with a mandate promoting Nondiscrimination against clients, stakeholders, supervisees, and colleagues. All of these come to our feld with diferent needs and backgrounds. Some of these individuals may hold biases which could prevent them from fully respecting any diferences in ethnicity, race, religion, or sexual orientation of clients or colleagues. Te code now addresses this issue head-on in requiring an Awareness of Personal Biases and Challenges. Provocation (i.e., engaging in behavior that is harassing or hostile toward others) is not allowed under any circumstance. Nonharassment is a clear policy for behavior analysts. It is all too easy to become friends with clients or supervisees, and the new code explains this challenge out by clearly discouraging Multiple Relationships. Multiple relationships can lead to conficts of interest that could instill distrust in our profession.</p><p>Section 1 â¢ 73 Tis version of the code allows modest gifs on an infrequent (no more than annual) basis from consumers who might feel slighted if they were refused. Also addressed is the potential for Coercive and Exploitative behavior that can arise given the power dynamic in delivery systems where there are entry-level behavior technicians working under master's and PhD level behavior analysts. Te power dynamic occurs because typically, behavior analysts at those levels are supervisors, company administrators, and executives. Equally disallowed are any Romantic and Sexual Relationships, which can easily afect the professional judgment of behavior analysts toward their clients and supervisees. Finally, the new code lays out a requirement for quickly Responding to Requests for information from clients, stakeholders, and others, as well as complying with requests for background checks and other practice requirements. Te code sets a standard for Self-Reporting of Critical Information regarding violations of the code or arrests, investigations, and similar incidents to the BACB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A CLOSER LOOK AT RESPONSIBILITY AS A PROFESSIONAL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.01">Being Truthful</head><p>Behavior analysts are truthful and arrange the professional environment to promote truthful behavior in others. T ey do not create professional situations that result in others engaging in behavior that is fraudulent or illegal or that violates the Code. Tey also provide truthful and accurate information to all required entities (e.g., BACB, licensure boards, funders) and individuals (e.g.,  Being truthful is one element of integrity. Being truthful is a value all behavior analysts should deliberately display in both their professional and personal lives. It would seem that being truthful would not be difcult considering that we work with a sciencebased treatments, we take data, and we use data to make our decisions in providing behavioral services. Te problem comes when there is pressure to shade the truth to avoid an embarrassing or painful confrontation with a client, supervisor, or administrator. Sometimes this pressure is self-caused, such as when you slept late, got caught in trafc, and arrived at the client's house 30 minutes past the appointed time. An apology is in order since there has been an inconvenience to the client, and here is where the truth hurts. You have to explain that you failed to set your alarm (the truth). Tis exposes you to criticism, so a lie about a power outage in your neighborhood gives you cover. Tere is always the risk that this lie could be found out later and result in even greater criticism. Responding with a lie also opens the door to another possible untruthful response. For example, when you f ll out your billing form, you might be tempted to indicate the assigned time to hide the truth of your lateness from your supervisor. T is moves into the far more serious category of fraudulent billing. Fraudulent billing is a crime and will be found out through an audit conducted by the insurance company.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Being truthful is a value</head><p>Pressure to engage in dishonest behavior can also come from the client who may want you not to report something you observed in the home. Examples that clients frequently do not want reported include abuse, neglect, or drug usage by a parent or relative. Some clients (including the parents) may want the behavior analyst to misreport the number of hours of service to lower their co-pay. Tere is also occasional pressure from one's supervisor or the administration to misrepresent a situation to the client. A common example of misrepresenting a situation occurs when the behavior analyst is told to inform a family that they need to increase their hours of service to 20 hours per week. When the administrator tells the behavior analyst, "Since this is a new</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 1 â¢ 75</formula><p>policy of the insurance provider, if the family doesn't increase their hours, they will be dropped," it puts the behavior analyst in a very uncomfortable spot. Tis is a true test of one's integrity to pushback and say, "I'm sorry, I cannot do that. It is just not true." Tis standard relates to professional integrity. It is also an example of personal integrity. Because behavior analysts work with vulnerable populations, our consumers put a great deal of trust in our basic respect for the law and our standing in the professional community. To "follow the law" basically means to be a law-abiding citizen in addition to upholding one's professional standards. Following the law means not racking up speeding tickets or getting arrested for driving under the inf uence (DUI). Following the law means paying child support on time, and following the law means you do not violate the rights of your neighbors. To become a behavior analyst, one has to pass a criminal background check. Any misdemeanor or felony convictions as an adult will be revealed, along with arrests prior to prosecution, and possibly some that did not lead to a conviction. Te length of time relating to how far back a background check goes varies from state to state. Some providers may administer pre-employment checks, which will include the aforementioned criminal checks as well as verifcation of education, previous employment history, and any professional licenses that have been granted or rescinded.  To be accountable for one's actions means f rst understanding the mission of the organization and what the goals are for each professional or group of professionals. Once that is established, a good behavioral organization will design a set of contingencies to support the behaviors that meet those goals and support the mission. Taking responsibility includes implementing consequences which are likely to be negative for not meeting goals and not following company protocols. As behavior analysts, we seem to take on multiple responsibilities simultaneously. All of these may be important to the organization and the lives of our clients. Failure to complete an assessment in a timely fashion means that a client may have to wait another month for services to begin.</p></div>

Te standard accepted practice in our feld is for professionals to give at least 30 days' notice of their intent to leave the organization. Tis could be a longer period if this is discussed upon hiring and included in the person's contract. Te dire efects of a sudden departure on the welfare of the client should be emphasized when the behavior analyst is f rst hired. Te prevention of sudden resignations can be prevented by regular meetings with management to make sure that the behavior analyst is happy with the work environment and has no plans to leave.</p><p>Accountability, which involves contingencies to support desired behaviors, needs to be in place for all levels of professional practice from the CEO on down. If the CEO or owner is not a BCBA, this presents ethical problems involving enforcement of our Code. With an organization that provides behavioral services, consequences, both positive and negative, must be applied fairly and consistently. If the mission and company goals are made clear to all and the contingencies are applied fairly, the organization should run smoothly and ethically, with happy employees and satisf ed clients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.03 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHOM?</head><p>"We have a clinical support team assigned to train, monitor, audit, and support our whole agency. In a recent clinical audit, our team discovered three potential ethical violations involving a newer BCBA consultant. T ese included the lack of a proper assessment prior to rolling out a behavior plan, no parent signature on an intensive behavior plan, and serious shortcomings in communications regarding a medically fragile client. Te director at this site should have been monitoring this but obviously was not. We are now in the remediation phase and have</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 1 â¢ 79</formula><p>confdence in our corrective action including additional training, more frequent audits, and a coach for the new BCBA. However, given that these three problems popped up in such quick succession, we are debating the level of disciplinary action and for whom . . .? Meaning, we feel there was a bit of lax oversight on the part of the BCBA director at the site. Would there be a clear way to differentiate if the warning should be given to the director versus the newer BCBA?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.04">Practicing Within a Def ned Role</head><p>Behavior analysts provide services only af er def ning and documenting their professional role with relevant parties in writing .</p><p>A professional role in ABA involves all of the functions that the behavior analyst fulf lls. Tese include conducting behavioral assessments, developing and writing treatment plans, training and supervising team members, implementing interventions, evaluating client progress, keeping therapy notes, communicating and consulting with families and administrators, advocating for clients, educating clients as to their rights and their involvement in the treatment process, and social worker-like functions involving client safety and well-being (e.g., being a mandated reporter) and more, depending on the agency involved. Tis standard specifes that the behavior analyst provides to the client(s), in writing, a list of the roles they will play in the service delivery system with each client. We believe that this is done most directly and efciently using a "Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures for Behavior Analysts," described in some detail in Chapter 13. Sections 1 and 2 of the Declaration spell out the behavior analyst's area of expertise and the nature of their practice as well as how they approach their work with the</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ client.</formula><p>A document similar to this should be generated for each client since the defned role may change from one client to the next. Te Declaration should be presented and discussed, and questions answered and signed by all parties before any actual treatment plans are initiated.</p><p>One frequent question regarding BCBAs who work for an insurance company or other funding source is, "What is the role of the insurance company and who do they represent?" It would appear that one function of the insurance company contact person is to save money for their company, and since they have virtually no contact with the actual client, they cannot represent the client's interests. Denying services that have been determined "medically necessary" by the client's physician and endorsed by the BCBA who has conducted an assessment and knows the client's needs directly would appear to represent an ethical issue that is yet to be resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.04 CONFLICTING ROLES</head><p>"I am currently functioning under two separate roles at my current place of employment.

Is it ethical for me to evaluate and diagnose a client as a registered psychology associate and then, following the conclusion of the evaluation, begin to treat that same client as an LBA <ref type="bibr">[Licensed Behavior Analyst]</ref>? It seems like this would constitute a dual relationship or possibly a self-serving way to solicit new ABA clients. Te reason I am asking is because a client I tested may be interested in and could beneft from ABA treatment. I suggested to the client's mother that she contact other BCBAs in our area, but she has recently e-mailed me to ask ABA-related questions. She sent me a video of her daughter engaging in stereotypic behavior and asked how to reduce the behavior. Although I think the answer is no, Scope of competence in behavior analysis is defned in detail in the Task List for each category of professional behavior. 1 Should a professional desire to expand their scope of competence, Code 1.05 requires that they engage in "appropriate" training and supervised experience, and they must document the nature of that training and experience. Since "appropriate" is not def ned, we recommend that behavior analysts, wherever possible, obtain a valid certifcation document to support their new skills. T is document should include the name of the person conducting the training or supervision, where the training took place, the dates of the experience, and the name of the agency that is certifying the experience. In addition, there should be a complete description of skills acquired matching the format used in the Task List for BCBAs.

One area that requires actual specifc training, for example, has to do with feeding disorders. An example of the expertise required to treat this problem can be seen in the exemplary article by <ref type="bibr">Peterson, Piazza, &amp; Volkert (2016)</ref>. 2 Te problem presented had to do with food selectivity, which is just one of several types of feeding disorders. In this detailed study that was published in JABA, the authors compared a modifed sequential oral sensory approach (which is ofen used by occupational therapists) to an applied behavior-analytic approach. A careful reading of this research clearly shows that the very specifc way that the behavioranalytic approach was used requires extraordinary training and experience. In this study, attention to detail played a critical role in order to protect the safety of the children. A BCBA who works in a suburban clinic with behavior problems such as noncompliance, mild aggression and sleep disorders should not accept a walk-in referral of a child with a feeding disorder. Tis would be a case of a BCBA operating outside their scope of practice/competence. Additional areas where specialization is required include SIB, sexual behaviors, phobias, Tourette syndrome, or sexual deviance.</p></div>

He was sure he would need more training and supervision, so he took some CEUs on ACT, anxiety disorders, and OCD. Afer the CEU training, he shared with me that he felt overwhelmed since the clinical director did not have time for any intensive supervision and could only include him in group meetings with the other BCBAs. He asked me if I thought he should quit but I suggested he request to be taken of the case. I said he For BCBAs, maintaining their competence is structured by the CEU requirements from the Board. Tis standard specif es the way in which that this can be done but it does not set any additional requirements and it does not def ne "competence." Te intent of this standard is to urge behavior analysts not to be complacent with the knowledge they have gained in the past or skills they acquired in their master's program and practicum training. Instead, BCBAs should stay on top of the rapid acceleration in applied research fndings that are being published every month. For example, the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (vol. 53, 2020) published nearly 2,500 pages of peer-reviewed, applied behavior-analytic research directly related to the profession. Certainly, focused reading of the articles relevant to one's specialty in this volume would be required to "maintain competence." In addition, there are half a dozen major conferences in behavior analysis that meet each year and probably another 20 local and state ABA associations that convene in one-to three-day conferences where national experts are invited as speakers and local practitioners present their latest work.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.07">New-Cultural Responsiveness and Diversity</head><p>Behavior analysts actively engage in professional development activities to acquire knowledge and skills related to cultural responsiveness and diversity. Tey evaluate their own biases and ability to address the needs of individuals with diverse needs/backgrounds (e.g., age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status). Behavior analysts also evaluate biases of their supervisees and trainees, as well as their supervisees' and trainees' ability to address the needs of individuals with diverse needs/backgrounds. <ref type="bibr">Skinner (1971)</ref> addressed the topic of culture in Beyond Freedom and Dignity, and it seems appropriate to bring his analysis to bear:  <ref type="bibr">( Skinner, 1971 , p. 127)</ref> Skinner's emphasis on observing behavior and the contingencies that produce it are relevant to developing "cultural responsiveness," since as behavior analysts, that is our strength. Although Skinner's writing related to cultural responsiveness is written in scientif c terms, and "cultural responsiveness" is not a behavioral term, behavior analysts should adopt cultural responsiveness as a value and they should have a very humane and empathetic approach to cultural responsiveness. Cultural responsiveness basically means that behavior analysts should be able to learn from people of every background, and that they should respect people from other cultures. Tis includes clients, client families, colleagues, staf , other professionals, and so on. In dealing with others, when it comes to language, cultural traditions, and life experiences, behavior analysts should acknowledge, recognize, appreciate, and validate and even celebrate, the diferences of others.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">"A child</formula><p>For clients, the treatment process should start with clientcentric, not expert-driven, goals.

Cultural humility is related to cultural responsiveness. While cultural responsiveness involves learning about and respecting the cultures of others, cultural humility has to do with examining one's own beliefs and cultural identities. As with cultural responsiveness, cultural humility is not a behavioral term either. In behavioral terms, we would say it is necessary to assume that the contingencies which produced the behavior are genuine, shared by family members, and that these contingencies need to be considered when conceptualizing a behavior plan that will ft comfortably in the family's environment.

T ere are two assumptions here: (1) that behavior analysts have biases that somehow might afect how they approach their clients, which they probably do, and (2) that by "evaluating" their biases, these biases will somehow be modifed. It is important to note here that we are a behavioral feld and to date, there is no ef ective behavioral technology for observing and measuring "biased" behavior. 3  Tere is also a similar absence of an evidence-based treatment for a bias that meets our research standards although there are several discussion articles worth reading <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fong, Catagnus, Brodhead, Quigley, &amp; Field, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Miller, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Leland, &amp; Stockwell, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wright, 2019 )</ref>.</p><p>In consultation with experts in this area, 4 some suggestions for evaluating biases follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUGGESTIONS FOR EVALUATING BIASES</head><p>a. One aspect of this ethics standard involves the suggestion that behavior analysts should evaluate their own biases and the biases of their supervisees and trainees <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fong, Catagnus, Brodhead, Quigley, &amp; Field, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fong, 2020)</ref>. Since this is not yet an area that is behavior-analytic, we must rely on the guidance from other professionals. Te American Academy of Family Physicians recommends several tactics that may be appropriate for behavior analysts to consider: 5 (1) explore and identify your own prejudices through conversation and analysis with peers; (2) consider experiences from the point of view of the person being stereotyped; (3) before interacting with people from certain groups, pause and ref ect to reduce refexive behaviors; (4) evaluate people based on their individual characteristics rather than relying on stereotypes;</p><p>(5) use statements that welcome multiculturalism; and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) support a culture of diversity and inclusion at the organization level. b. Prior to the frst visit to a client/family, there should be some discussion about the linguistic needs of the family and whether a translator might be needed. In addition, it may be helpful to have some basic demographic information about the family and their culture (e.g., religious practices, family routines, mealtimes, food preferences, and house rules, such as leaving shoes at the door). It may be necessary to do some homework on the client's culture if this is new to you so you can determine specifcs. For example, what is culturally appropriate eye contact, and what the preferred method of conversation? Paying attention to the client's preferred conversational unit can also make for a better interaction. Some people speak in shorter units and make it obvious that they have completed a thought and are ready for a response.</p><p>Others are accustomed to longer segments of speech before being ready for a "turn" to let the other person speak. 6  Consideration should be given as to the appropriate dress for those involved in the home visit. A client from a traditional background with regard to dress may be ofended by a behavior analyst who is dressed too casually for the occasion. c. At the very frst contact with the new client, perhaps on intake, the emphasis should be on efective dialogue that is client-centric. Te purpose of this initial conversation is to learn about the client's family culture, daily schedule of activities, preferences, and priorities so that the behavioral treatment endeavor is a collaborative efort. Some questions to get the conversation started follow. "Can you tell me a little about your daily routine? " "When do you think would be the best time for a therapist to come to your home?" and "We depend on the use of rewards to strengthen behaviors.  As behavior analysts, we need to not lose track of the fundamental concept of culture. As Skinner wrote, "A culture is a set of practices"; 7 these are behaviors that a group of people hold dear and want to perpetuate. Our job as professional behavior analysts is to respect those practices to the extent that they do not put our clients at risk for harm.</p></div>

Since beginning services nearly seven years ago, the client has always chosen to be female characters during pretend play, female avatars during online play, and when working on safety skills related to dressing for weather, asked to shop in the girls' section. Mom and dad have been uncomfortable with this in the past, but It seems contrary to the values of behavior analysts that they should engage in any form of discrimination against a client, staf, or other behavior analyst in their organization. Unfortunately, this is sometimes an issue. Tere are three ways that his might happen. First, a BCBA might wrongly discriminate against a client based on race, ethnicity, skin color or disability by not providing the same quality of service that they do with other clients of a diferent race, ethnicity, skin color or disability (or any other category listed in 1.08). Tis could include not valuing the client's input into goals and objectives, not monitoring closely to ensure that RBTs are maintaining independent variable (IV) integrity in the treatments, determining that goals have been met and beginning the discontinuation paperwork when the client is not ready, or not managing the treatment process so that adjustments in procedures are implemented in a timely fashion. Other more subtle forms of discrimination may appear as "microaggressions," including "brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities" <ref type="bibr">(Sue et al., 2007, p. 271)</ref>, which are certainly worth addressing.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>Second, a BCBA could discriminate against supervisees in several ways based on their age, gender expression, marital status, or socioeconomic status (or any other category listed in 1.08) by not giving them enough hours of work, frequently canceling supervision sessions, giving inadequate feedback that does not improve performance, giving them unfair assignments (e.g., driving long distances to client locations), assigning them to clients where they have no experience with the behavior challenges, sending them on in-home assignments where it is dangerous or unsafe, talking down to them one-on-one or in meetings, or refusing to sign their supervision paperwork without justif cation. Te power dif erential between BCBA supervisors and their supervisees increases the likelihood that a behavior analyst could use racial slurs or make ofensive comments about a supervisee's race or color, or they could engage in sexual harassment by making inappropriate sexual advances or requesting sexual favors. A supervisee may be of a diferent religion than their BCBA supervisor, and there could be discrimination in the form of making joking or of ensive remarks about the supervisee's religion, failing to recognize their religious holidays in making work assignments, not allowing them to fex their schedules to accommodate these holidays, or commenting negatively or sarcastically on their clothing or grooming practices.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>Te third way that a BCBA might engage in discrimination is if they are in an administrative position as a director, owner, clinical director, or other powerful position, and they treat the behavior analysts beneath them unfairly based on age, marital status, or national origin status (or any other category listed in 1.08) in terms of denying company benefts such as disability, maternity leave, failure to consider them for promotions within the company, or by issu-There are endless ways ing unfair discipline.

Harassment is any form of behavior directed toward a person that is unwelcome or ofensive. Harassment creates a work environment that is intimidating, hostile, or ofensive to reasonable people. Harassment is illegal if the victim considers the conduct to be "intimidating, hostile, or abusive." Tis includes "of ensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, ofensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance." 10 T e harasser might be a co-worker, supervisor, or someone who works for the employer and could even be a client. Te company where the Harassment is illegal if harasser works is "automatithe victim considers the cally liable for harassment" if it produces "termination, fail-conduct to be "intimidating, ure to promote or hire, and hostile, or abusive". Tis is a new standard for behavior analysts to add to their repertoire. Tis standard has a heavy cognitive loading given the "awareness" factor that is required. Te reference to "personal biases" that may interfere with professional work assumes that (1) behavior analysts have biases and biased behavior and (2) this biased behavior will be displayed in public and interfere with their work. Te dictionary defnition of "bias" includes "an inclination of temperament or outlook, especially a personal and sometimes unreasoned judgment: prejudice." 12 We recognize these as nonbehavioral terms and suggest that behavior analysts do their best to engage in self-monitoring their behavior when making decisions about others including clients, supervisees, and colleagues. You might also consider asking a close friend or associate if they believe that you are bringing any personal biases into your professional work and then take steps to remediate those behaviors so as to treat others fairly in all circumstances.</p><p>Tere is a considerable amount of online material related to "bias in the workplace." Some examples include:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 1 â¢ 95</formula><p>â¾ Af nity bias-a tendency to gravitate toward people like you â¾ Ageism-discrimination against people based on their age â¾ Conf rmation bias-a tendency to look for information that confrms currently held beliefs â¾ Gender bias-assuming that one gender is better than another for certain jobs â¾ Weight bias-judging a person negatively because of they are heavier than average.</p><p>Tese are just a few there are many other types of biases as well. 13  Te second part of Code 1.10 refers to personal challenges. T e intent here is for behavior analysts to monitor their own performance and make sure that any addictions such as alcohol, drug, gambling, or video-game related habits do not become an impediment to their work. With easy access to illegal drugs and the wholesale encouragement of the use of alcohol as a social lubricant, some in the professions succumb to these temptations, and their work as a behavior analyst subsequently suf ers. Professionals should engage in self-monitoring, anticipate any lapses that might occur, and make other arrangements to have their work covered by other qualifed professionals when necessary. Behavior analysts should also arrange to have their work covered whenever stress, a change in a life situation (e.g., breakups, divorce, death in family), or other conficts negatively af ect their professional performances.</p></div>

I have also noticed in recent conversations with her regarding Multiple relationships, are more ofen referred to as dual relationships since these are much more common, are one of the most prevalent and sticky issues in our profession today. While they may occasionally lead to a confict of interest, this is not the biggest concern. Two of the most common situations related to multiple relationships are (1) an RBT or BCBA working with a family fnds that they have developed a friendship such that the family begins to treat them like a close relative rather than a highly qualifed independent professional; and (2) A BCBA or RBT who works closely with another professional begins to develop more than just a working relationship, i.e., the relationship moves toward a friendship and then to a romantic situation. In either case, the concern is that the professional judgment of the behavior analyst becomes compromised to the detriment of the client(s).</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>Tis standard advises behavior analysts to "resolve" these dual relationships, which means to cease the relationship through some means, such as transferring an RBT or BCBA to a dif erent family. Tis is ofen the best solution, since getting a family to change their tactics and stop inviting the behavior analyst to stay for dinner, cease giving them gifs, and no longer invite them to social events is just too much to ask. A "plan" to resolve the dual relationship usually consists of allowing it to exist for a short period while a replacement staf member is sought.</p><p>Code 1.11 refers to "confict of interest" as though it is equivalent to a dual relationship; however, this is incorrect. A conf ict of interest involves two parties that have diferent "interests." In behavioral terms, we would call these reinforcers. "A conf ict of interest arises when what is in one person's best interest is not in the best interest of another person or organization to which that individual owes loyalty." 14 A BCBA may, for example, recommend that a child receive more hours of service in order to increase their billable hours; scheduling additional hours may be a burden on the family and unnecessary for the child to improve her language skills, this is a clear confict of interest.

"A conf ict of interest can also exist when a person must answer to two dif erent individuals or groups whose needs are at odds with each other. In this case, serving one individual or group will injure the other." 15  An example of this exists when a behavior analyst/clinical director admits additional clients to their clinic to make their numbers look good to their board of directors, but which puts a burden on an already overworked staf who are showing the strain of excessive caseloads. Ethically, new potential clients should simply be put on a wait list or referred to other agencies in the area. A f nal example of a confict of interest is an admissions ofcer who arranges for an assessment of a client but then puts them on the wait list where they are essentially trapped, since the assessment funds are now depleted, and the client cannot move to another provider.</p></div>

Behavior analysts make clients and stakeholders aware of this requirement at the onset of the professional relationship. A gif is acceptable if it functions as an infrequent expression of gratitude and does not result in f nancial beneft to the recipient. Instances of giving or accepting ongoing or cumulative gifs may rise to the level of a violation of this standard if the gifs become a regularly expected source of income or value to the recipient.</p><p>Tis standard represents a signifcant policy change from the previous ethics code which specifed no gifs of any value were allowed due to the potential for creating a dual relationship (see Code 1.11 for the downside of dual relationships). Many families have a strong tradition, sometimes tied to cultural values, of showing their appreciation for an act of kindness or even as a welcoming gesture for visitors to their home, by ofering them food or drink. Having a professional come into the home not just once but repeatedly and for hours at a time for months on end creates a very unusual situation where families ofen feel compelled to show their gratitude with something tangible. In a family's conversations with the behavior analyst, they may determine that the person lives alone, eats primarily fast food and would surely enjoy a home-cooked meal. One thing leads to another, and soon the behavior analyst is being invited to stay for dinner, attend a birthday party, or join them on a trip to the beach with the family, all expenses paid. T ese ofers may be hard to resist, but this sets up an unspoken understanding of the need to respond in kind at some point in the future.</p><p>No matter what culture one comes from, giving is almost never a truly selfess act, since reciprocity of some kind is expected. "We're human beings and we're calculating people and we never do anything without some sort of eye toward the future," says Dr. Laver. Te French sociologist Marcel Mauss, in his seminal study of gif giving, T e Gif, explained that social bonds are reinforced by the mutual exchange of gif s. He noted, "In theory, such gifs are voluntary but in fact they are given and repaid under obligation." 16   Te new standard in the code related to gifs seems to disregard this larger, historic cultural obligation and assumes that the gifing will be a one-way street from the client to the behavior analyst. Te code does caution that at some point it is possible for gif giving to become a violation. It could be dif cult to determine when gif giving has crossed the line and even more diffcult to enforce. For example, companies would need to set up an honor system of self-reporting-of-gifs for behavior analysts so</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 1 â¢ 101</formula><p>as to determine whether they have become "a regularly expected source of income." Next, monetary amount and frequency will have to be specifed. "Is it $40 a month over 2 months? Is that regularly expected? Or do we need to set that at 6 months?" And of course, if the client is doling out gif cards valued at $10 each, it is quite clear that this is a f nancial beneft contrary to Code 1.12.</p><p>Our advice is for agencies and organizations to decide for themselves how they want to handle the troublesome question of gifing and determine if adopting a policy of "No Gif ing Allowed" might still be the best policy. If this is their position it needs to be included in the service agreement (aka the Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures; see Chapter 13) and explained to families in advance, with frequent reminders, so that they will not think the behavior analyst is rude or have hurt feelings of being rejected. Behavior analysts also need to make clear that their biggest reinforcer is the improvement in behavior of the client so there is no need for any additional reward.</p></div>

I was f attered since she was my boss, and she was very smart and successful. I had a boyfriend at the time and so did she. Her boyfriend was another employee. I started to avoid her and not reciprocate her eye contact unless I absolutely had to. She became upset and wouldn't speak to me or look at me unless she had to in a meeting. Tis was disconcerting as I enjoyed the rapport and I tried to be more friendly. She responded to this by starting to say firty things to me about me having her babies and even went on a rant about the BACB's absurd rule of not dating supervisees until two years past the end of the relationship.</p><p>During my competency assessment, she came up behind me and whispered that she could not take me out because we could not have a sexual relationship. I freaked out and went home early that day, I did not come to work the next day for the same reason. When I came back, my supervisor was angry and looked scared as though she made a mistake. I was exceptionally angry as I felt she was playing with my emotions and seemed to fnd it amusing.</p><p>My coworkers were jealous because I was ultimately promoted. I really believed it was earned as I worked so hard and was always complimented on my intervention and interaction with my clients.</p><p>I felt traumatized and needed therapy afer all of this as I kept having fashbacks of all my negative interactions with these people. I tried to leave multiple times, but they always convinced me to stay. Even in the end, one boss asked me to stay. Te one who liked me initially clearly wanted me to leave at that point. From your perspective, what should I have done besides leaving sooner?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.15">New-Responding to Requests</head><p>Behavior analysts make appropriate eforts to respond to requests for information from and comply with deadlines of relevant individuals (e.g., clients, stakeholders, supervisees, trainees) and entities (e.g., BACB, licensure boards, funders). Tey also comply with practice requirements (e.g., attestations, criminal background checks) imposed by the BACB, employers, or governmental entities.</p><p>Tis new standard appears to be in response to problems that some clients have had with their provider not giving them needed information when they transfer to a diferent agency. In some cases, those requests might have been for the case notes that therapists and supervisors ofen make for their own use, and this information is not always shared. Here are some examples of what needs to be provided for the stakeholders, clients, and trainees listed below:</p><p>1. Parent/caregiver: Progress reports for the family to share with the school or physician, information surrounding daily health habits or associated symptoms they may be tracking (foods eaten, toileting details, when a bruise appeared), details surrounding a problematic behavioral incident. 2. Supervisees: Assignment requirements, supervision forms, or feedback related to performance and assignments. 3. Trainees: Assignment requirements, supervision forms, or feedback related to performance and assignments. 4. BACB: Recertifcation deadlines, clarifcations or responses to complaints fled against them, requests to participate as subject matter experts. 5. Licensure boards: Recertifcation deadlines, clarif cations or responses to complaints fled against them. 6. Funders (insurers): Clarifcations surrounding treatment plans, appeals and responses, or phone calls for peer-to-peer reviews defending medical necessity, audit requests for treatment notes, data and dates of service, assessments, and so forth.</p><p>7. Funders (schools): Clarifcations surrounding treatment plans, behavior intervention plans, direction on treatment and interpretation of data, requests for meetings, guidance on parent concerns, training for aides and teachers.</p></div>

You are the subject of an ethics requirement violation, a disciplinary investigation, action or sanction, fling of charges, conviction or plea of guilty or no contest by a governmental agency, health care organization, third-party payer, or educational institution; 2. You are named on any public health-and safety-related f nes or tickets; or 3. You have a physical or mental condition that would impair your ability to competently practice.</p><p>To help you decide if you need to self-report to the Ethics Department, the BACB has provided a series of questions for you to answer. Each one requires a "Yes" or "No" answer, and if you answer "Yes" to any question, then you must self-report. A portion of this form is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">6</ref>.1.

I believe he has more mental health challenges than autism, although he may be on the spectrum.</p><p>He is growing more and more irrational and emotionally unstable, yelling, and screaming at me and others, insulting staf in meetings, and generally escalating in his reactivity and rage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESPONSES TO CASES CASE 1.01 PERILS OF TELLING THE TRUTH</head><p>You did the right thing by asking if there would be any retaliation for telling the truth, but in a case like this, it is advisable to get the response in writing for your own protection. Basically, you were lied to by the BCBA, and this is a clear violation of code 1.01. Tis is reportable to the Board if you have the documentation to back it up. You could also fle a complaint with the HR department of your former company. Finally, yours may have been a wrongful termination, and it may be against the law in your state. Check with an attorney to see if you have a case. Here is a link about how to do that: employment.f ndlaw.com/losing-a-job/wrongful-termination-claims.html.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.03 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHOM?</head><p>Te new BCBA needs a warning, a yellow fag, that they are not yet ready for prime time. Tey need to be coached to ask more questions, get a review of their work by their supervisor before it is made ofcial, and perhaps some shadowing of a senior BCBA. T e BCBA most likely got a serious dose of reality when he/she heard about what could have happened if that had not been caught-sleepless nights, self-doubt, and so on. A warning plus the coaching intervention should do the job here.</p><p>Te supervisor needs to understand that taking on a rookie BCBA is not an easy task and that they are held accountable for this person's actions, so a warning to them is also appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.04 CONFLICTING ROLES</head><p>No, you cannot evaluate a client and then later serve as their therapist. Tis could easily be seen as a confict of interest, since diagnosing a person and then accepting them as a client could obviously appear as self-dealing. Te proper thing to do is to complete the diagnosis and then provide the client with a list of providers in the area. You could list your company last, but do not indicate that you are associated with the company. Tis way, you give the person the choice of where they would like to go for treatment, and you are free of the appearance of a confict of interest. Even though the mother trusts you, the right thing to do is give her the list of providers and let her make the choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.05 SCOPE MISMATCH</head><p>My advice is for the new BCBA colleague to request in writing to the owner to be taken of the case. He should provide reasons stressing operating in the client's best interest and the concern that this exceeds the colleague's scope of competence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.07 DO NO HARM</head><p>Tis is a very difcult situation, since your job as the behavior analyst is to primarily watch out for the best interest of your client. In this case, this is diametrically opposed to what the parents are asking. As is ofen the case, it is time for some persuasion. Our advice to the parents is to not use contingencies to try and shape this child into accepting a non-preferred gender role. Tis is not likely to work and could cause harm to the child psychologically. Ten, we strongly support our idea of bringing in a professional who is an expert on gender-related topics to provide guidance to the family.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.08 DISCRIMINATION AT WORK</head><p>Tis sort of discrimination in the workplace is totally unacceptable as well as illegal. You need to meet immediately with HR and with the owner to discuss remediation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.09 WHO IS DOING THE HARASSING NOW?</head><p>If you have previously given a written warning to the family about the inappropriate harassment, you can terminate immediately.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.10A IS IT A BIAS?</head><p>Tis does not appear to be a case of a bias against the family. From the BCBA's perspective, her personal trauma obviously af ected her deeply so that matching her with this family is not in her or their best interest right now. So that there is no harm done to the family, the BCBA's supervisor should be carefully removed from the case. And, if there is a way for her to receive some counseling to help her work through the trauma, that would be a kindness and service one would want to extend to a valued employee. Even if counseling was accepted, this will not be an overnight recovery; it could take weeks or months to accomplish. Tere can be a fne line between a person's bias and a conditioning history that has produced a traumatic reaction. Behavior analysts and supervisors need to be prepared to sort these out and make the right call.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.10B QUITE A CHALLENGE</head><p>One of the most complex layers of mental health challenges is that insight and judgment may be impaired. Hence, someone may lack the capacity to recognize that their issues are impacting their ability to perform their work duties, or that their problems are reducing the quality of their work products. So, while the idea of inclusion in the code is terrifc, and while it aligns with what other professions also say, it may not lead to self-identifcation of the need to modify work obligations/protect clients. It falls to supervisors and administrators to be on the lookout for and to react appropriately to these circumstances.</p><p>Tis is a situation in which coordination with HR is imperative. HR needs to take the lead on how such issues are managed within the company. Employee rights to privacy and to protection given any disability are paramount. In general, the assessment of competence and capacity to resume work would be best lef in the hands of those fully trained to make such assessments. Behavior analysts or even HR personnel are not fully skilled in these areas. T is is a specialized skill set, ofen within psychology. HR may consider such evaluations by qualifed professionals as part of continuance of employment.</p><p>If someone is walking around voicing thoughts of suicide, it is a potential crisis. Tis person needs help. Begin with HR, both to guide modif cations to work requirements/leave of absence and to access services and supports. If ineligibility to resume is determined, the supervising BCBA should remove the person from the list of RBTs for which they are responsible. HR could work with the person to self-report or might report them, depending on circumstances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.11A CONFLICT OF INTEREST GOES TO SCHOOL</head><p>Tis is a clear confict of interest and a violation of Code 1.11. It would be a good idea to start by trying to address this informally. You need to fnd out who this person's supervisor and arrange a meeting to discuss your concerns. Be sure to follow this up in a memo that begins, "As per our meeting this morning, here were the concerns that I expressed." If it turns out that the school is not concerned about this confict of interest, it would be appropriate to report this person to the BACB via Notice of Alleged Violation.</p><p>In addition to your frsthand information, they will require some documentation to be able to take any action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.11B AN EXTREME MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIP</head><p>Tis an outrageous example of a violation of Code 1.11. We strongly recommend that you fle a Notice of Alleged Violation with the BACB.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.12A SO MANY QUESTIONS</head><p>First, by "infrequent expression" we interpret the code to culturally appropriate events such as Christmas or Chinese New Year where, for some families, it is their custom to give out small gif s of appreciation and where refusing a gif would harm the relationship between the behavior analyst and the family. Behavior analysts must now be aware of their client's culture and the context in which a gif might be ofered. Not all holidays involve giving gif s, for example. So, the question of "How ofen?" boils down to something simple, like once per year. Anything more of en could create a dual relationship, which is not allowed. It is advised that each company develop a policy for their employees clearly describes the gifing policy. Te policy might range from "No gifs under any circumstances, so please nicely inform all of your clients ahead of time about this" to "Our policy is that if refusing a gif less than $10 would cause a problem with the family, then it can be accepted as long as it is no more ofen than once per year." Each company will have to develop their own policy and take responsibility for the education of employees and enforcement of the policy. Our interpretation is that it would be unethical under this code for behavior analysts to accept food or a $10 gif card on a regular or even intermittent basis from a family.</p><p>Second, if a family wants to give a gif of any size to a school or agency, this should be handled through some internal of ce independent of the behavioral services team (e.g., the fnance or business ofce) so that the gif to the team is essentially from an "anonymous" donor. Tis way, the size of the donation/gif doesn't matter. A parent would not be allowed to bring lunch or snacks to every IEP meeting, and this would need to be covered in the company policy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.12B SPLITTING HAIRS ON GIFTING</head><p>Tis rule is likely to cause a lot of discussion. You would probably not be reported to the Board if, afer doing the math, you determined that the gif bouquet came out to $10.25 per person. As discussed in the previous case, each company, clinic, agency, and organization will now need to develop policies and procedures to accommodate this change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 1.12C DON'T BE RUDE</head><p>It is probably not possible to determine the value of these meals, so we would not worry about trying to stay under the $10 limit.</p><p>Once a week seems excessive, but if the family prepared their special dishes once a year, that is probably acceptable. One meal does not need to be reported to the Board, but your company needs to be made aware of this. Te larger concern has to do with the development of a dual relationship with the family (see Code 1.11 Multiple Relationships), which is certainly possible since dining with others is one of the primary ways that personal bonding occurs in our culture. You may want to consider having your company develop a policy and procedure around situations like this including a def nition of "infrequent." Ten, if at some point this practice was disputed, at least the company can say they attempted to identify possible risks associated with dual relationships, including potentially damaging the therapeutic relationship with a client.</p></div>

However, I had no other way for accruing supervisory hours for the BCBA certifcation since a contract is required. She reduced the bill to only include 5% of the hours. I contacted an employment lawyer to f ght the at-will contract I signed at the beginning of my employment. I believe she ended up speaking with the owner of the company, a BCBA-D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PRACTICE OF BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS</head><p>In the early days, our feld consisted of experimental psychologists applying the principles of behavior to "subjects" they encountered in the residential units of state institutions. Tese pioneer behavior analysts most ofen had no training in clinical psychology.</p><p>Tey believed that behavior could be changed using procedures derived from learning theory. Tere was no question about where the responsibility was; it was clearly with the employer. T e "client" (although that term was not used initially) was the employer.</p><p>Te client/employer was of en a superintendent or adminis-Wyatt v. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Stickney (1971 )</ref> put trator of the facility. In some behavior analysts on notice cases, the parents of a child were the "clients."</p><p>that a paradigm shift had</p><p>It was not until 1974 that occurred.</p><p>the concept of a client's "right to treatment" surfaced. "Right to treatment" emerged from the landmark Wyatt v. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Stickney (1971)</ref> case in Alabama. In this case, it was argued that institutionalized mental patients had a right to receive individual treatment or be discharged to the community. Although the case really did not have anything directly to do with treatment per se (e.g., it dictated increases in professional staf , improvements in the physical plant, and how many showers a patient should receive per week), it blasted the term right to treatment into the legal arena. Wyatt v. Stickney put all psychologists, including behavior analysts, on notice that a paradigm shif had occurred. In behavior analysis, we immediately became sensitive to the possibility that our "client" might be harmed by our procedures, and in a short period of time, "clients' rights" were the new watchwords.</p><p>Te original trial judge, Frank M. Johnson Jr., set forth what later became known as the Wyatt Standards. Tis case set a precedent and put all mental health and retardation professionals on notice that their services had to be delivered in humane environments where there were suf-Following the Wyatt restrictive environment.</p><p>Following the Wyatt decision, if you were assigned to work with a client in a residential facility, it was clear that you had not only an obligation to the facility to do your best work but also a responsibility to the person on the receiving end of the treatment to make sure he or she was not harmed. Tere was concern in the beginning that "behavior specialists" (they were not yet called behavior analysts) would manipulate "client" behavior just for the convenience of the staf , such as punishing clients who were incontinent so that staf members would not have to change their diapers. Over time it became evident that, ethically speaking, it was only right to consider the needs of the actual client along with anyone else who might be afected by the procedures (e.g., staf, parents, guardian, or other stakeholders). Tis immediately made the behavior specialist job far more difcult. By the end of the 1970s, behavior analysis was becoming more prevalent and visible, and behavior analysts found themselves working with other professionals on "habilitation teams" to determine the right treatment for clients. T us, the beginning of issues concerning consultation and cooperation with other professionals arose. In addition, there began to be dif erentiation of the roles of the entities, and concerns developed about "third-party" involvement. If a client (frst party) hires a behavior analyst (second party), presumably there is no confict of interest, and the client can fre the behavior analyst if he or she is not satisfed with the services. Likewise, the behavior analyst will do his or her best to satisfy the client's needs so that the behavior analyst will be paid for his or her services. Tis arrangement has built-in checks and balances. But if the behavior analyst is hired by a third party (e.g., a facility) to treat the behavior of one of its residents (frst party), there is a In the late 1980s, the ABA presumption that the behav-convened a blue-ribbon ior analyst will work to satisfy panel of experts to reach the needs of the third party to consensus on right to keep his or her job.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>treatment.</head><p>By the 1980s, behavior analysis was much more visible in mental retardation treatment circles and was accepted by many as a viable strategy for habilitation. It was around this time that the further trappings of service delivery had to be accommodated. It was clear that clients had rights (both under the US Constitution and the Wyatt Standards), and that everyone, including the behavior analyst, had to respect them and certainly to be informed of them prior to treatment. Furthermore, with behavior analysis approaching the mainstream of accepted approaches, other protections had to be put in place. Clients had a right to privacy, and arrangements had to be made to protect their privacy and conf dentiality (this was pre-HIPAA). Records had to be stored and transferred in a way that maintained these rights, and behavior analysts had the same obligation as other professionals to obtain consent to disclose the information.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the time had come for behavior analysts to speak out on the issue of right to treatment, and the Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA) convened a blue-ribbon panel of experts to reach some consensus on the topic. A consensus was reached and ultimately approved by the governing body of the ABA that essentially stated that clients had a right to a "therapeutic environment" where their personal welfare would be of paramount importance and where they had a right to treatment by a "competent behavior analyst" who would conduct a behavioral assessment, teach functional skills, and evaluate the treatments. Te ABA panel fnally concluded that clients had a right to "the most ef ective treatments available" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Van Houten et al., 1988)</ref>. T is reference to ef ective treatments set the stage for behavior analysts to redouble their eforts to make a direct connection between the published research and the application of empirically tested interventions.</p><p>Section 2-Responsibility in Practice provides a clear and detailed list of the obligations of behavior analysts who treat clients using behavioral procedures. By accepting these responsibilities and taking them seriously, we can guarantee that our clients will receive the f rstclass treatment they deserve and that, as a profession, we</p><p>As behavior analysts, we will have demonstrated our are charged with using only respect for their rights as conceptually consistent, we provide state-of-the-art evidence-based methods. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preview to Responsibility in Practice</head><p>Providing Ef ective Treatment starts with prioritizing clients' rights as well as their needs for treatment.

Tese services need to be delivered in a Timely fashion along with related paperwork responsibilities without Disclosing Conf dential Information while Protecting T eir Documents. When services are rendered, there must be Accuracy in Billing and Reporting and the Fees need to be fair and duly represented to clients. Communicating About Services needs to be done in the language of the client and without jargon; this includes explanations of assessment and behavior-change procedures before they are implemented, and results explained in the same understandable format; showing the clients your credentials at the onset of services is also required. Involving Clients and Stakeholders in the selection of goals, assessments, and behavior-change interventions is also required, along with progress monitoring and reporting.</p><p>Collaborating with Colleagues and compromising on treatments, when possible, when it is in the best interest of your client is advised. A very important step to keep in mind when assessing clients and developing their programs is to Obtain Informed Consent (be sure to check the Glossary for the key elements) from the client and stakeholders ahead of time. Behavior analysts always Consider Medical Needs when doing an assessment and seek a medical referral if there is any reasonable likelihood that there are medical or biological factors present. Being conceptually consistent in the Selection, Design, and Implementation of Assessments and Behavior-Change Interventions is of course a central theme of behavior analysis. We always Describe our Behavior-Change Interventions Before Tey Are Implemented and Minimize Risk with Tese Interventions. Collecting and Using Data for making decisions about continuing or modifying treatments and Continually Evaluating Our Interventions is a must for our feld. And fnally, although this is probably best done early in the chain of events, we need to Address the Conditions that could Interfere with Service Delivery, which includes the behavior of others including parents and stakeholders. Neutralizing or removing those barriers may be necessary, and calling in other professionals may also be necessary. Documenting everything is essential.</p></div>

Behavior analysts do not allude to mysterious, theoretical causes of behavior inside the body or recognize their related therapies such as Reiki, energy healing, or guided meditation. Other pseudoscience "therapies" include biomedical treatments like chelation, Lupron therapy, 2 and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. 3 One additional group of nonevidence-based approaches includes treatments such as horseback riding, dolphin-assisted therapy, facilitated communication (FC), rapid prompting method, zones of regulation, essential oils, and spelling to communicate. 4 Conceptually consistent methodology, on the other hand, conforms to the seven dimensions of ABA outlined by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in 1968. 5 Tese include that</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>an intervention must be (1) applied, (2) behavioral, (3) analytic, (4) technological, (5) relate to operant principles, (6) be ef ective, and ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) and generalize over time and to other behaviors and other settings.

However, if they are following the requirements of 2.01(a)-(d), they probably would not even consider taking up the practice of any of the pseudoscientifc methods described above. But, if a behavior analyst does use non-evidence based treatments, the maxim is No Comingling of Treatments. If BCBAs choose to perform hot yoga therapy with clients, they need to separate the yoga and behavior analysis, so the public is not confused. "ABA Hot Yoga" would not be allowed, since that is the comingling mentioned earlier. Te behavior analyst could ofer "ABA Treatment by J. Jones, BCBA" on one website and "Hot Yoga by Yogi J. Jones" on another website as a solution.</p></div>

(b) Use secure, HIPAA-approved sofware when transmitting documents or data. (c) If other people in your organization have access to or process your data or your communications, make sure that they have been properly screened including background checks, drug tests and credit checks. (Why credit checks? A person who is deeply in debt may take risks with your information if they see an opportunity to proft from sharing it.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.04">Disclosing Conf dential Information</head><p>Behavior analysts only share confdential information about clients, stakeholders, supervisees, trainees, or research participants: (1) when informed consent is obtained; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(2)</ref> when attempting to protect the client or others from harm; (3) when attempting to resolve contractual issues; ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) when attempting to prevent a crime that is reasonably likely to cause physical, mental, or fnancial harm to another; or <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(5)</ref> when compelled to do so by law or court order. When behavior analysts are authorized to discuss confdential information with a third party, they only share information critical to the purpose of the communication.</p><p>Te circumstances under which you might need to release confdential information on a client are rare and those are spelled out in this standard. However, some additional clarif cation might help. (a) Disclosing confdential information when informed consent is obtained means that you may disclose conf dential information if your client has given you permission to do so. T e client must sign a consent form to allow this to happen. For example, if a relative is moving into the residence to assist with childcare during a stressful time, the client might want the relative to know what is going on with their child's behavior plan so that they can interact with the RBT staf during their in-home sessions. (b) Confdential information may be disclosed when attempting to protect the client or others from harm. Tis standard is relevant in a situation where the client has done something to attract the attention of law enforcement while you are out in the community. To keep your client from being treated like a criminal, you might need to inform the deputy that he is autistic, he is under your care, occasionally has outbursts, and that he is no danger to others. You would explain he is simply having an episode because the burger they gave him at McDonald's had three pickles on it and they are "touching!" (c) Te need to disclose confdential information when attempting to resolve contractual issues is highly unlikely since contractual issues arise in a slow and methodological manner. Tere will be plenty of time to have the relevant parties discuss the release of confdential information. (d) Conf dential information may be disclosed when attempting to prevent a crime that is reasonably likely to cause physical, mental, or f nancial harm to another. Tis situation might come up in the community as well. If you are out with your client and can see that he is about to touch someone inappropriately, and you make a quick decision to use a blocking response, you might also say something like, "I'm so sorry. If she sees someone that has a purse like hers, she thinks they have stolen it from her. Terry is language-delayed and instead of using her words, she will try to grab the person's bag. Again, I'm sorry and hope that this has not caused you any distress. I am a behavior analyst, and we are treating this problem. Here is a card with my name and my supervisor's name, please feel to call her if you have any question." (e) Confdential information may be disclosed when you are compelled to do so by law or court order. Tis is self-explanatory; if you fnd yourself in court for some issue in connection with a client (e.g., a custody case), the judge may require you to release certain information. In a situation such as this, it is acceptable to release the information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.05">Documentation Protection and Retention</head><p>Behavior analysts are knowledgeable about and comply with all applicable requirements (e.g., BACB rules, laws, regulations, contracts, funder and organization requirements) for storing, transporting, retaining, and destroying physical and electronic documentation related to their professional activities. Tey destroy physical documentation afer making electronic copies or summaries of data (e.g., reports and graphs) only when allowed by applicable requirements. When a behavior analyst leaves an organization, these responsibilities remain with the organization.</p><p>Tere has been considerable confusion about the status of documents that result from behavior-analytic programming. T is standard clarifes this issue. Once a behavior analyst moves from one organization to another, they are no longer responsible for documents from the organization they lef . Tey are not required to take copies with them, and once they leave, they are not responsible for securing documents. Securing the documents becomes the responsibility of the organization. While a behavior analyst is still working for an agency or clinic, they are responsible for making sure that all client documents are safe and secure. Transferring hard copies to digital format is allowed under certain circumstances, but you must check on company policies, and the company must remain in compliance with funding agencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.06">Accuracy in Service Billing and Reporting</head><p>Behavior analysts identify their services accurately and include all required information on reports, bills, invoices, requests for reimbursement, and receipts. Tey do not implement or bill nonbehavioral services under an authorization or contract for behavioral services. If inaccuracies in reporting or billing are discovered, they inform all relevant parties (e.g., organizations, licensure boards, funders), correct the inaccuracy in a timely manner, and document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Billing is most ofen handled by the business ofce at the company where the behavior analyst is employed, so this standard will not be much of a burden. Tere is one exception, however, and that is reporting on time spent with a client. Tis is the infamous billable hour. Billable hours must be honest and accurate. Otherwise, the billing is considered fraud.</p><p>Since ethical behavior analysts will probably not be involved in delivering nonbehavioral services, there should not be a problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 2 â¢ 137</formula><p>related to billing for nonbehavioral services under an authorization for behavioral services. One of the most frequent questions sent to the Ethics Hotline is where the BCBA is also a licensed speech therapist or counselor. Tese double-credentialed professionals do have to take care to keep their two dif erent therapies separated for billing purposes. For example, if a BCBA/SLP has a two-hour session with a client where they use behavior-analytic procedures to make the speech session run more smoothly, they will have to determine which treatment plan and authorization services are being rendered. Tey are not allowed to bill for both. Care should be taken to record the exact start and stop times for services. Tis should be coupled with session notes that support the services rendered according to the intent of the billing code used. Since this sort of billing is complicated, it is a good idea for the double-credentialed professional to consult with an expert on billing and insurance to establish the rules that apply in these situations.</p></div>

In situations where behavior analysts are not directly responsible for fees, they must communicate these requirements to the responsible party and take steps to resolve any inaccuracy or conf ict. Tey document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Because most behavior analysts work for a for-prof t company or non-proft organization, there will be little need for them to worry about sharing fee information. Tis will be handled by the business ofce. A related factor is that fees are of en limited by what private insurance or government agencies will allow. If a behavior analyst is in private practice, this standard will apply to them. T e goal is to be honest and up-front with clients so that there are no hidden charges that would make clients feel like they are being cheated or manipulated.</p></div>

She then proceeded, with our permission, to observe our son at school. We knew we would be charged for this as well. She also consulted with numerous other people on our son's team <ref type="bibr">(teachers, speech therapist, etc.)</ref>. Her fee schedule mentioned that she charges for any consultation time above 15 minutes. Before contacting these people, she never reminded us of this, nor did she ask how long we would give her permission to be on the phone at our expense. We were not present for these phone calls, so we had no control, and she did not make the people being consulted aware of the charges. "She has now charged us a very large sum for these calls as well as her calls to us beyond the initial phone interview.

T is seems to be a key omission that might allow a behavior analyst to try and reach a parent by phone, perhaps leaving a message, and then proceed with the assessment and intervention without the parent ever knowing anything about it. Tis can cause a backlash where our clients do not trust our intentions. We believe the ethical behavior analyst will put the "Must . . ." back into 2.08 and always keep the consumer or stakeholder informed at every step of the way and gain parental/stakeholder written informed consent at each step as well.</p></div>

T ey are responsible for explaining, obtaining, reobtaining, and documenting required informed consent. Tey are responsible for obtaining assent from clients when applicable.</p><p>Informed consent is a process required by APA for researchers when setting up experiments that involve human participants and by hospitals before a patient undergoes surgery. 8 Informed consent involves describing the purpose of the research, the procedures, how long it will go on; it should indicate that participants can withdraw at any time, inform them of the potential risks involved in participation as well as incentives for participation, and they also need to be informed of possible research benefts. In addition, this type of consent may also need to include information about the limits of conf dentiality when the research is published and who they can contact if they have questions. While informed consent is of en associated with research, the term has become widely used in clinical and therapy settings.</p><p>So, what is the diference between consent and informed consent? Consent (aka ef ective consent or general consent) means that the behavior analyst is required to explain to the client/stakeholder, in plain language, basically what the assessment or treatment involves.

From the description above of informed consent, some of these steps can be omitted (i.e., incentives for participation and research benef ts).

"Consent may only be given by individuals who have reached the legal age of consent (in the United States, this is typically 18 years old). Assent is the agreement of someone not able to give legal consent to participate in the activity. Work with children or adults not capable of giving consent requires the consent of the parent or legal guardian and the assent of the subject." 9  Bottom line: Behavior analysts will need to have a thorough understanding of their company's (agency's, organization's) policy on consent versus informed consent and be aware of the requirement for assent for those under 18 years old. Te goal of this requirement is that the client/stakeholder be fully informed of what is about to happen to them or their child. T is should be done in such a way that there are no surprises involved that would cause the behavior analyst to lose the client/stakeholder's trust and therefore full cooperation.</p></div>

Tey document referrals made to a medical professional and follow up with the client afer making the referral.</p><p>Tis standard about considering the medical needs of clients is modifed slightly from the previous Code. Now the behavior analyst is to ensure that if there is possible medical or biological involvement, there will be proper referrals made and followed up on with the client. Tis gives BCBAs a little more clout in their requests to caregivers and stakeholders to seek medical assessment and, if necessary, to request the proper treatment for behaviors that are not operant in nature. T e frst question that arises is, "When do I need to request a referral to a physician?" T is depends on the nature of how the problem presents itself. In some cases, an experienced behavior analyst might realize during the intake process that there is something of about the referral. Examples would be an onset of the behavior when there were no changes in the environment; a report of an injury that is played down by the parents coincidental with the appearance of the behavior; a change in medication or a new medication under similar circumstances; a report of concomitant signs of bruising, rashes, or loss of appetite; or a sudden escalation of a behavior that had been at a low level for a long time. Any of these and more symptoms suggest that something medical/biological is going on with this client. Te medical/biological signs should be explored or ruled out so that you can begin behavior-analytic treatment with a clear conscience. A complication in this logical approach to ethical treatment involves the caregivers. What if they are informed of the behavior analysts concerns but fail to make the appointments, or make them and then cancel at the last minute? Can you as the behavior-analyst start treatment anyway? Te answer is No. To</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 2 â¢ 147</formula><p>do so would not be in the client's best interest. If there is a failure to follow through, your obligation is to consult with your clinical director to determine the best path forward to meet the larger objective of putting your client's needs f rst.

Tey select, design, and implement assessments with a focus on maximizing benefts and minimizing risk of harm to the client and stakeholders. Tey summarize the procedures and results in writing.</p><p>Tis standard related to selecting and implementing assessments combines several previous code items and adds new guidelines. Tis standard covers a lot of behavioral territory and it may be easier to follow if we enumerate the individual parts: (a) f nd assessments that are behaviorally based (and of course "scientif c"). Tis eliminates many popular educational and developmental assessments, (b) that best meet the needs of the client, and then (c) implement the assessment to beneft the client and minimize harm. (d) Produce a report which describes the procedures and the results and present them to the client and relevant stakeholders. Tis sounds clear-cut, but a closer examination reveals that there are many assumptions that are made here, and a lot of information is lef out. It is assumed that the behavior analyst has had one or more courses on behavioral assessment, and that this knowledge has been "reinforced" by hands-on, supervised experience in a setting with a variety of clients and presenting behaviors. Behavioral assessment is an enormous feld that covers the full range of problematic behaviors from simple classroom of-task, out-of-seat behaviors, and preference assessments to more complex adaptive, language, social and pre-vocational skills assessments for a wide range of children and adults. At the even more complicated end of the scale are the assessments for serious aggression, destruction, and SIB, as well as feeding disorders, clients with severe disabilities, those with tics, phobias, attention defcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pica, and medical complications including the evaluation of a client's medications. A behavior analyst must also stay up to date on advances in research on brief functional assessments, FBA, and interview-informed synthesized contingency analysis (IISCA) as well as being aware of the limitations of each of these methods of assessment in terms of reliability and validity. A subscription to JABA is the essential tool for any behavior analyst wanting to meet the requirements of Code 2.13. Tere are hundreds of articles on behavioral assessment to analyze and digest in those 50+ volumes of our f agship journal.</p><p>We also recommend: Since most assessment data that will need to be collected by either family members or other stakeholders, you will have to consider the possibility that they may not meet your standards for dependent variable (DV) integrity or be accurate or consistent in their data collection. Tey may also introduce their own bias. For example, some stakeholders might skew the data so that they may receive more services, while others, wanting to please the therapist, may show that a treatment is efective when it is not. Since assessment data are used to determine the most appropriate behavioral treatment, it is extremely important that the data are recent, relevant, accurate, and benefcial for understanding the client's baseline status for any setting. It is also important that assessment data will allow for a determination of the ef ectiveness of one or more interventions over time. Tis code lays out the sequence of events that behavior analysts follow in developing their interventions. It seems unnecessary but needs to be repeated that we always start with methods that are "conceptually consistent" with basic behavioral principles. Tis means we work with operant (i.e., learned) behaviors that are observable and measurable and procedures that are evidence based. Our scientifc evidence comes primarily from our f agship journal, the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, plus several other journals that publish similar research based on behavior principles and methodology. As per Code 2.13, behavior analytic interventions are based on the appropriate behavioral assessment that points us toward the controlling variables for the behavior of interest. As a feld, we have an overarching interest in the powerful use of reinforcers to change behavior and generally discourage the use of aversive control (see <ref type="bibr">Code 2.15)</ref>.</p><p>Every behavior analyst wanting to meet these objectives faces a very difcult task: translating basic principles or f ndings from a published study into a workable, practical, socially acceptable, contextually relevant intervention with few risks and minimal or no side ef ects that nonetheless quickly produces socially signifcant ef ects that are welcomed by the parents/caregivers and any stakeholders that may be involved. If all of this comes together, the question of whether any positive changes will "maintain under naturalistic conditions" is completely dependent on whether the reinforcement system as designed stays intact. It also depends on if the natural environment is such that it will provide the amount and type of reinforcement of behavior necessary for maintenance. Changes in these settings is almost always out of the realm of control of the behavior analyst, so an evaluation of the intervention should not be based on the expectation that once the behaviorchange is achieved, it will somehow magically last forever.</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 152 â¢ Ethics Standards CASE 2.</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.15">Minimizing Risk of Behavior-Change Interventions Behavior analysts select, design, and implement behaviorchange interventions (including the selection and use of consequences) with a focus on minimizing risk of harm to the client and stakeholders. Tey recommend and implement restrictive or punishment-based procedures only af er demonstrating that desired results have not been obtained using less intrusive means, or when it is determined by an existing intervention team that the risk of harm to the client outweighs the risk associated with the behavior-change intervention. When recommending and implementing restrictive or punishment-based procedures, behavior analysts comply with any required review processes (e.g., a human rights review committee). Behavior analysts must continually evaluate and document the efectiveness of restrictive or punishment-based procedures and modify or discontinue the behavior-change intervention in a timely manner if it is inef ective.</head><p>Te safety of the client is upmost in the mind of the behavior analyst and this standard related to minimizing risk of</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 2 â¢ 153</formula><p>behavior-change interventions discusses two aspects of that concern: (a) behavior analysts always minimize the risk of harm, and (b) when using restrictive or punishment-based procedures, they frst have demonstrated that less restrictive and aversive techniques have not worked.</p><p>While we do not always discuss it, whenever consequences are used to change behavior there always some risks involved. With positive reinforcers, there is a risk if they are not carefully chosen, edible reinforcers can produce allergic responses, cause clients to gain weight, and afect food preferences. If not used carefully, a therapist can accidentally reinforce the wrong behavior or cause an extinction burst.</p><p>Generally, we do not use restrictive methods or punishing contingencies because of the wide-ranging side efects and the limited direct ef ects (i.e., narrow stimulus control). If the use of punishment/aversive control is under serious consideration, an appropriate human rights committee should be consulted. T is should be a committee independent of the agency putting the proposal forward. If approved, there needs to be intensive training for those involved and very close monitoring of the intervention to ensure that there is no misapplication. Punishment/aversive contingencies ofen work quickly or not at all, so the intervention team needs to be prepared to make changes or stop the procedure depending on the outcome.</p></div>

Tey also provide explanations when modifying existing or introducing new behavior-change interventions and obtain informed consent when appropriate.</head><p>Assuming all the previous steps have been completed properly, this standard related to describing behavior-change interventions before implementation requires that the behavior analyst describe in writing what they are proposing to do.

A fnal note includes what you need to do if there are modifcations to the intervention(s). If they are minor, then these can be made within the existing BIP, but if there is some major change, the ethical thing to do is go back to the parents/ caregivers, explain the changes, and ask again for consent. Use a modifed form for this, including the rationale for the change, what the change will entail, if the parents/stakeholders must be involved, and how this will be evaluated.</p></div>

It is what we are known for and should not be difcult to accomplish, however, in a high percentage of cases, data collection is a problem. We assume that data is collected each day that an intervention is in place. Following the rule from applied researchers, this data is graphed each day and evaluated to determine how the treatment is going. In keeping with current business lingo, there needs to be an ef ective "supply chain" in place for this to happen. It begins with the therapist, usually an RBT, who has been given a set of precise topographical or functional defnitions by their BCBA supervisor. Te RBT is trained on those defnitions until they are reliable. Next the RBT is provided with a data-collection procedure including recording forms or a computer-assisted device of some sort.

Tis analysis should be done weekly, and the data shared with relevant parties including the parents/caregivers, teacher, and clinical director who would ideally input the data into their dashboard for a big-picture analysis of organization ef ectiveness. T e "corrective action" that might be taken could vary from modifying the schedule of reinforcement, changing the reinforcer, modifying the task analysis, changing the rate of stimulus fading, conducting a new FBA, or in some cases conducting an overall review to determine if the whole strategy is wrong and a new analysis is needed.</p></div>

Parents ofen seek support from multiple professionals, some of whom may be promoting approaches which are antithetical to behavior analysis such as weighted vests, brushing, or special diets. It is as though these parents believe "more is better." If the intervention is benign, an alternative is to propose to the other party that you take data to determine if it is efective. If you are taking and analyzing your data as described above and you see that there is a decrease in performance coincident with the onset of one of these treatments, it is time to have a serious discussion with the appropriate person or professional.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.19">Addressing Conditions Interfering With Service Delivery</head><p>Behavior analysts actively identify and address environmental conditions (e.g., the behavior of others, hazards to the client or staf, disruptions) that may interfere with or prevent service delivery. In such situations, behavior analysts remove or minimize the conditions, identify ef ective modifcations to the intervention, and/or consider obtaining or recommending assistance from other professionals. Behavior analysts document the conditions, all actions taken, and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>At the outset we should note that "addressing" an issue does not mean that there is an obligation to solve it. Addressing an issue only means that it is acknowledged, documented, and appropriate steps are taken which may mean delaying treatment until there is some sort of resolution.</p><p>Te two main categories of interference with service delivery are (a) people, usually caregivers, but sometimes other stakeholders; and (b) environmental issues. Te "people problems" we encounter include parents or caregivers who are passive or indifferent as to their role in the implementation of our service delivery strategies, or in some cases, they are antagonistic.</p><p>A fundamental precept in ABA is that we behavior analysts have the job of discovering controlling variables for behavior, designing efective interventions which we can implement ef ectively (given cooperation), and then our task is to hand of the behavior plan to the parent, teacher, or other caregiver. Tis should be made clear at the intake phase before the client is accepted for treatment. We recommend using a Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures for Behavior Analysts to codify this process. T e parents or caregivers should sign this document afer it is reviewed by their behavior analyst, and they will receive a copy for their future reference. Tis important document is discussed in more detail in Chapter 13. Note that not all caregivers will agree to the terms of this "contract," and behavior analysts need to be prepared to see them walk away before the frst reinforcer is ever delivered.</p><p>It is common now for contracted behavioral services to include a required (by the funding agency) parent training component. T ere is some stigma associated with this terminology, so an alternative might be sought. We recommend behavior coaching, which takes the sting out of an expression that suggests that parents are inadequate and need to be trained to be parents. Behavior coaching can be applied to anyone who might need to be involved in implementing the behavior plan including relatives, siblings, nannies, or the teacher or classroom aides at school. One sad and dif cult-to-discuss barrier to treatment might be the condition of the child clients themselves. Ofen, they are unwell, malnourished, mistreated, or abused. If, because of their condition, they are not ready for behavioral treatments, the goal of the behavior analyst becomes f nding professionals that can be brought in to provide appropriate assistance.</p><p>Environmental issues that can interfere with successful implementation include inadequate resources (not enough staf , not enough money, not enough allotted time, inappropriate environment for treatment), disruption in the environment (noise level, too hot, too cold, too many people, too much "stuf" due to someone with hoarding disorder), and a dangerous living area (e.g., drugs, weapons, unsanitary conditions, and insect/rodent infestations).

You could ofer to show them how it is done or even help them assuming there are proper consents from the parents/caregivers. <ref type="bibr">Code 2.10</ref>  Te concern is that you suggest something specifc, your colleagues try it (at least their version of trying it) and it doesn't work, or worse backfres, then they blame you and your "stupid behavior analysis!" Tings that don't usually backfre are positivereinforcement based methods of reducing behavior like dif erential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI) or dif erential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO). Sometimes a good starting point is helping colleagues understand that some behavior is a communication attempt.</p><p>With regard to recognizing a client's behavior might be a communication attempt, a behavior analyst contacted the Ethics Hotline to inquire about a case. Te behavior analyst was working with a family and child with ASD. When the child wanted something out of the refrigerator, he would fall to the foor and have a small tantrum. Te parents responded by pulling food and drink items out of the refrigerator and giving them to the child until the tantrum stopped. Clearly, a behavior like this could be shaped into pointing or some verbal approximation to what the "mand" is all about. T e behavior analyst might be able to work examples like this into situations where functional communication is operating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 2.11 ASSENT APPLICABLE?</head><p>Te notion of assent is essential. Assent is required in research and is considered good practice in clinical settings. Assent is not a legal requirement in health care. Assent is about explaining procedures to clients and getting a sense of their understanding. It is a good idea to include this anytime you are proposing a behavioral procedure. Some behavior analysts ofer choices to clients and accept their choosing as giving assent. Other clinicians accept a lack of resistance as assent. A concern is that sometimes resistance to routines and tasks is the precise reason for service, so resistance might be the target behavior. Your organization should review the other resources available at https://training.ontaba.org, and seek consultation from a mentor or supervisor on how to best incorporate the principles of assent in your workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 2.12A BARRIER TO BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT</head><p>For this case, there are numerous questions that should be asked: Do you have a background and training in SIB? How serious is the SIB? How frequent? Is the client going to the hospital or seeing a physician to treat the injuries? Is there any reason why the parents are not taking care of the medical issues? If they are neglecting the client, Child Protective Services should be called. T ese symptoms are serious and possibly beyond a family physician.</p><p>Step one is to follow the guidance of Code 2.12 and make sure that the SIB is not just a result of the symptoms that you are describing above. Once that is resolved, then you need to do an FBA that will get to the bottom of the causes of the SIB. Next you can write a behavior plan based on your experience and the extensive evidence base that exists on SIB.</p><p>It is not ethical for you to work on a behavior reduction plan when the medical needs are not being met.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 2.12B LEGAL PRESSURE TO TREAT</head><p>Tis is a complex situation as there is much to consider medically. Paramount to this case are Codes 1.05, ensuring we practice within our boundary of competence, and 2.12, seeking medical consultation when necessary. As a BCBA, if you have limited knowledge in cerebral palsy and so on, you may need to pass this case to someone with a better working knowledge as well as strongly recommend consultation with a medical professional. If your client's MD has limited availability, it is extremely important to make clear to all relevant stakeholders how this efects your ability to accurately determine function as medical conditions must be ruled out frst (parsimony). Tis should be followed with potential solutions (seeking an additional doctor, scheduling to meet with the doctor when he is in during the month, etc.).</p><p>Since this this is a low frequency behavior, a QABF may be helpful in forming a hypothesis and gathering more information. T e following are some references that discuss strategies for analysis of low-rate behaviors. While not exact matches, they might be helpful.

Tere are ways of setting up a data sheet ahead of each session (your supervisor should do this for you) so that you can brief y pause and mark the type of response that the child gave. Your supervisor should be observing you regularly and doing interobserver agreement checks to make sure that your data are accurate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 2.18 IS FC A DEAL BREAKER?</head><p>In this case, a behavior analyst could continue working with that client/family. You, as the behavior analyst, have an obligation to try and educate the parent about the lack of scientif c evidence behind-and the harm of FC. Do that the best you can. Also, we are obligated to inform the parent of behaviorally based procedures to build the skills for which the parents are using FC. If you have done all of this, and the parent continues to use FC, and the use of FC does not negatively impact or "take away from" the ef ectiveness of your services, then there is not much else you can do.</p><p>However, if the FC interferes with the gains you are trying to make via behavior analysis, then you are obligated to discuss that concern with the parent. To be more blunt with you, if the FC is taking up time that could be used to implement behavior analysis, and as a result you do not have enough opportunities to do behavioral therapy in a sufcient dosage to make progress, then you are obligated to change that situation by convincing the parent to use FC less and/or to give more opportunities to you to provide behavior analytic services. As a last resort, you could consider terminating services according to Code 3.15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 2.19 PUSHED TOO FAR</head><p>Tis situation sounds chaotic. You have done a good job navigating an impossible situation. Could the sessions be clinic based for the 30 days? Tis would protect staf in this situation and might change the extent of her behavior. It would also provide the time for the transition. Because there is volatility here, DCF and welfare checks are important. Have you referred her for crisis counseling and a crisis evaluation? Does your clinic provide those services? If not, can you refer to them? Be sure to document everything. Be sure to ofer transition services and provide a fnal treatment summary.

We suspect she is also discussing her current situation with other parents with a negative tone. Te clinic-based services have not seemed to impact her behaviors positively, unfortunately. I feel like we have gone to great lengths to provide great services for the child throughout this and assist in supporting the family in any way possible within our scope of practice. To this day, she continues to disregard our policies. I feel it is important to protect the staf at this point too.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NOTES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PREVIEW TO RESPONSIBILITY TO CLIENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS</head><p>Te primary responsibility that behavior analysts have to their clients and stakeholders is to operate in their best interests and to do no harm. In doing so, it is important to recognize that others around the client may need to be included in the discussion. Depending on the circumstances, this might be a sibling, grandmother, a teacher, or a social worker in addition to the primary caregivers. Anyone who can provide support should be included as a "stakeholder." One problem that can surface is when behavior analysts realize they do not have the resources to treat the client ef ectively afer they have already accepted the client for services. Tis can be prevented by a very objective analysis of client problems from the beginning and referring them to another provider who is more suited to their needs. BCBA caseloads must be considered when accepting clients.</p><p>One of the most important procedures to preventing misunderstandings in the treatment process is the use of a service agreement (see Chapter 13), which details all aspects of both client and behavior analyst responsibilities to the goal of helping the client achieve their goals. Tis document should spell out the billing practices and the circumstances under which it might be necessary to consult with other providers and third-party contractors. If consultation with other providers is necessary, clients must be informed and provide informed consent for these services. In the events that unusual circumstances should arise, also included in the services agreement should be a statement regarding conf dentiality and the limitations of confdentiality. Behavior analysts are by nature data takers. Extending this practice to documenting their work so that it can be easily used by another provider is essential to producing a seamless delivery of services when a transition to another provider is required.</p><p>Advocating and educating clients is another aspect of behavioral treatment. We want clients to receive the highest quality evidence-based services possible, and we do everything possible to obtain the appropriate amount and level of treatment. To avoid service disruption, we always plan for possible emergencies and have staf on hand to fll in, in case an RBT or BCBA needs to be absent from work.</p><p>Discontinuing services for a client can be cause for celebration if they have met all their goals. However, other contingencies may require a diferent approach. For example, in some cases, a client may reach a plateau and is no longer benef ting from behavioral treatment, so a referral to another provider may be necessary. Occasionally the client or stakeholder decides to drop the services or are non-compliant with an agreed-upon behavior plan, in which case discontinuation is in order. Tere may be circumstances where the behavioral staf do not feel safe working in the home or with clients who present dangerous or threatening behaviors in which case discontinuing services may be in order. Finally, changes in funding sometimes requires the discontinuation of services. Regardless of the reason, when discontinuation of services is necessary, behavior analysts leave clients with a behavior plan that can be shared with another provider if the client wishes to do so.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A CLOSER LOOK AT RESPONSIBILITY TO CLIENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.01">Responsibility to Clients (See 1.03, 2.01)</head><p>Behavior analysts act in the best interest of clients, taking appropriate steps to support clients' rights, maximize benefts, and do no harm. Tey are also knowledgeable about and comply with applicable laws and regulations related to mandated reporting requirements.</p><p>Tis is an important, fundamental standard that should be the highest priority for all behavior analysts in human services. T e nature of the business is that there are so many other contingencies in play that we ofen forget why we are here-for the client. Contingencies such as keeping a client on the roster so that RBTs can be employed, or to contribute to the bottom line, or to just make a parent/caregiver stakeholder happy can be powerful motivators that have nothing to do with the best interest of the client. We have discussed clients' rights in Chapter 7 under Code 2.01 and urge everyone to review those ofen. A discussion of clients' rights should be included in company meetings with supervisees and trainees. When we are respecting a client's rights and pushing for those rights to be a part of the discussion of client goals, we are operating in the client's best interest. Unfortunately, most clients are not necessarily aware that they even have certain rights.</p><p>Te last part of this standard refers to behavior analysts being mandated reporters. Te law establishing mandatory reporting varies from state to state, so review the law from your state to best understand your obligations. Mandated reporters include daycare workers, staf in doctor's of ces, police of cers, social workers, teachers and teacher aides, and just about anyone employed in the human services, which of course includes behavior analysts. Behavior analysts include not just BCBAs but also RBTs and BCaBAs. It is important to know that you do not need permission from anyone to call the Abuse Hotline or Child Protective</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>Services (CPS) if you suspect abuse. Some companies tell their RBTs that they must frst check with their supervisor before making the call since the company feels like they will lose a client (the concern about the bottom line again) if the family f nds out that someone from their behavior analysis agency reported them. T e laws written by the states allow anonymous reporting and do not punish people if they make a good faith efort to report the abuse of a child even if it turns out not to be so. Falsely reporting abuse just to cause someone trouble could be considered a crime of malice and will get the reporter in trouble.</p></div>

Te origin is in the 18th century and had to do with someone who had a "stake" in a wager or bet. 1 If you put money on the table in a card game or on a horse race, you were a stakeholder. T ere has been some evolution of the term over time, and now it refers to "people inside and outside an organization who have a vested interest in a problem and its solution." 2 Te term has currency in the business arena, where determining stakeholders and dealing with them in various ways so that a new project can move forward is a required part of a successful "product launch" strategy. In this venue, stakeholders can be "active backers" or "active blockers" depending on their attitude, their interest, and their power. In behavior analysis, the term "stakeholder" appears to be a little more benign, and the general meaning is, "Who needs to have a say and be kept informed? " Consider the case of a child with an elopement problem, and then imagine how each of these stakeholders might react to an RBT running down the hall af er a child, out the back door, across the playground, and headed toward an intersection. Some of this is obvious. If you are working with a child in a public school, the teacher is a clear stakeholder, since they must be involved in the implementation of any classroom intervention.

And what about the sherif's deputy who is the on-duty security of cer? How about the special education director, the school psychologist, and the school nurse? How much involvement would they want? And how much say is there in the treatment plan itself? T is new standard raises many questions for behavior analysts particularly with regard to the "obligations" for each stakeholder's involvement. Consider one more scenario where you are working in the home with a child who has aggression against two siblings, the parents, and the family pet, their Beagle "Molly." As an exercise, try to imagine how you would involve each of them in the development of a BIP (behavior intervention plan). Who else might be a stakeholder?</p></div>

Behavior analysts document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>In practice, a BCBA may not be the one involved in accepting clients for treatment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.04">Service Agreement (See 1.04)</head><p>Before implementing services, behavior analysts ensure that there is a signed service agreement with the client and/or relevant stakeholders outlining the responsibilities of all parties, the scope of behavioral services to be provided, the behavior analyst's obligations under the Code, and procedures for submitting complaints about a behavior analyst's professional practices to relevant entities (e.g., BACB, service organization, licensure board, funder). Tey update service agreements as needed or as required by relevant parties (e.g., service organizations, licensure boards, funders). Updated service agreements must be reviewed with and signed by the client and/or relevant stakeholders.</p><p>Tis standard lays out the requirements for the "service agreement" that you will develop for each client and relevant stakeholders. Many stakeholders are bystanders who just need to be aware that the client is receiving treatment and they are neither "blockers" or "backers." Tis is very similar to what we refer to as a Declaration of Professional Services and Practices, which is described in detail in Chapter 13. Te service agreement described here includes:</p><p>1. Responsibilities of all parties-this includes an obligation on the part of the client family and related stakeholders to treat all treatment staf with dignity and respect at all times. Also included should be a statement that RBTs are to be considered as professionals and not a part of the family to avoid them getting involved in multiple relationships with any of the stakeholders. Additionally, mention should be made of the requirement that one adult must be in the home at all times when the therapist is present. Tere should also be a description of how potential missed appointments will be handled. 2. Te scope of behavioral services being ofered-in this section, there should be a description of the kind and frequency of behavioral services. Tere should be a statement that these services are delivered according to a behavior plan that will be presented to the client for approval. Te agreement says that the client cannot make frequent changes to the plan, and that such requests need to be handled by the BCBA (not the RBT) on site. 3. Te behavior analyst's obligations to the code of ethics-here the BCBA needs to hand the client a copy of the code highlighted to show relevant items for the client's case. T e BCBA should provide a description in plain language of what each item means to the client as a consumer. 4. How to submit a Notice of Alleged Violation to the Board and other organizations involved in the service delivery endeavor. Most importantly, the client needs to know who to contact at the insurance company or other government agency if they suspect billing fraud or other abuses. Te written agreement is signed by all relevant parties, and each one receives a copy.</p><p>Omitted from 3.04 are two additional and important items that occur later in the code:</p><p>5. As per Code 3.15, the service agreement must also include "circumstances for discontinuing services." Tis should be sufciently detailed so that if this clause needs to be activated, it will not come as a surprise to the client and related stakeholders. 6. As per Code 3.16, "Behavior analysts include in their service agreement the circumstances for transitioning the client to another behavior analyst" should the need arise. It is expected that this will be carried out seamlessly so that the client does not sufer any backsliding in their behavior repertoire. BCBA is then under the contract signed by the provider group.</p></div>

If the recommendations from the frm include treatments with which the schoolbased behavior analyst does not agree, the behavior analyst is obligated to operate in such a way that will protect the child's (client's, student's) "care and welfare."</p><p>Another example might be a child client (the frst party) receiving 20 hours of treatment per week at a behavior-analytic clinic (second party) that is paid for by the family's insurance. At some point, the insurance company (the third party) reviews the case and makes a determination that the child only needs 10 hours of treatment per week. In this example, the behavior analyst, following Code 3.08, is expected to push back, represent the best interest of the client, and make the case to the insurance company that the medical necessity of the client requires a full 20 hours per week.</p><p>In Code 3.07, the student (frst party) attends a school (second party). Te school district or possibly a judge (third party) requires the services of an outside behavior analyst (not the school BCBA) who is now working at the behest of that organization. Specifcally, the outside BCBA's client is the third party. T is outside behavior analyst is now required to make sure that the contract for services meets these fve detailed specif cations. T is could present some complications because the contract was likely prepared by someone else who is not a behavior analyst and is totally unaware of Code 3.07. Te outside BCBA then must review the proposed contract, mark it up for revision, and send it back to the third party for modifcation. Once it meets the requirements of 3.07, the outside BCBA can sign the contract and presumably present it to the family and the school for review and approval. Once all three parties agree to the terms of the contract, then the work by the outside behavior analyst can begin.</p><p>An example of each of the fve elements that a contract must contain are:</p><p>1. Te responsibilities of all parties: Te behavior analyst would ensure that each party is aware of their role in the provision of behavior analytic services. For example, the behavior analyst's role is to deliver services, the third party's role is to make services available to clients, and the client or client's representative's role is to provide consent for treatment. Stating this within the services agreement or contract ensures there are no questions later about the role of each party. 2. Te scope of the behavioral services to be provided: T e behavior analyst should operationally defne and list each specifc service that will be delivered under the contract.</p><p>When contracting with a school, a behavior analyst might conduct a behavior assessment, develop a treatment plan, train teachers and paraprofessionals, and report data and progress to the IEP team. Te behavior analyst would def ne each of these activities and include examples of how each service is delivered. Te more specifc the defnition of the service, the better; this will ensure that the third party knows what is being agreed to within this contract. 3. Te likely use of the information obtained: T e behavior analyst should ensure that the parties involved in the contract are aware of how information will be used. For example, the behavior analyst may conduct an assessment on a behavior which requires one or more caregivers to be present due to safety concerns. Te behavior analyst should explain that the results of this assessment will be reviewed with the parties of the contract to ensure they are aware of the need for extra supervision. It is easy to outline this within a contract by saying something to the efect of, "T e information obtained through the assessment process will be used to identify safety measures to be taken to prevent injuries." 4. Te behavior analysts' obligations under the code: In every behavior analytic contract or service agreement, it should be stated that the behavior analyst is obligated to follow the Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts. By making this statement up front, it allows for the behavior analyst to make decisions later that may result in termination of the contract. For example, if a third party is asking a behavior analyst to perform a task that is outside of the defned scope of services defned in Section 2 above, the behavior analyst may cite the ethics code as a reason that they are not able to complete that task and may need to make other arrangements for the client to receive services from someone else. Tis can also save the behavior analyst from getting into unethical situations that may arise in the delivery of services. 5. Any limits about maintaining conf dentiality: T e behavior analyst should describe eforts to maintain conf dentiality and list any limits to maintaining conf dentiality. T e best practice would be to obtain training in HIPAA, as this</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 3 â¢ 189</formula><p>ofen is the gold standard of confdentiality and protecting the health information of clients. Another good practice is to adhere to the confdentiality practices of the party with whom the behavior analyst will be contracting. T e behavior analyst may need to learn about the third party's conf dentiality practices prior to describing this in detail within the contract.</p></div>

Te circumstance described here would represent the position of the BCBA working with and representing the best interest of a client, when they have been requested by an external organization such an insurance company to reduce the number of hours of service. If the BCBA stands by their recommendation, they are required to resolve the issue and they cannot simply concede. In this case, this would mean persuading the insurance company to not reduce the hours of service by showing data that demonstrate a strong need for the time necessary for the treatment. Tis will involve some negotiation skills and possibly some pushback. If it involves skills that the BCBA does not have, then the person may need to ask for a specialized consultant to be brought in or request additional training. Te worst-case scenario here is that the BCBA will tell the third party that they cannot provide the service and that the third party will need to seek someone else. Te BCBA should document all these transactions and the outcome.</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 3 â¢ 191</formula></div>

Confdentiality can be a matter of signifcant importance to clients, parents, caregivers, and stakeholders, and it is critical that client information be carefully guarded against breaches that could in some way cause harm. 5  Client records lef in the open or in unlocked fle cabinets could be obtained by someone who could cause harm to the status of the person. Parents and stakeholders, for example, may not want their child's autism diagnosis exposed to neighbors who, by virtue of knowing this, might tell their children not to play with the client or spread rumors around the neighborhood. Similarly, parents of a student who is being evaluated by the school psychologist may not want that person to know the child was previously diagnosed with ADHD since this might bias their results. However, there are some circumstances in which conf dential information can be exposed. Examples are provided below, but remember the exact laws are established by each state legislature. In Chapter 13, we provide an example of a Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures for Behavior Analysts. If you look at Section 5, you will see one way to communicate these limitations to your clients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONFIDENTIALITY</head><p>Here is a way to communicate conf dentiality limitations to your clients:</p><p>In [insert your state], clients and their therapists have a confidential and privileged relationship. I do not disclose</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 3 â¢ 193</formula><p>anything that is observed, discussed, or related to clients. In addition, I limit the information that is recorded in your file to protect your privacy. I need you to be aware that the confidentiality has limitations as stipulated by law including the following:</p><p>â¢ I have your written consent to release information.</p><p>â¢ I determine that you are a danger to yourself or others.</p><p>â¢ I have reasonable grounds to suspect abuse or neglect of a child, disabled adult, or an elder adult. â¢ I am ordered by a judge to disclose information.</p><p>In your presentation to your clients, you may want to use a description like this:</p><p>â¢ If there was some confidential information you wanted me to convey to someone, I would need to have a Consent to Release Information Form filled out and signed by you. â¢ If a behavior analyst believes that you are likely to harm yourself and/or another person, they may do whatever is necessary to protect you or others by contacting law enforcement ofcers or medical personnel. â¢ If a behavior analyst has cause to believe that a child has been or may be abused or neglected, the behavior analyst is required as a mandated reporter to make a report to the appropriate state agency. â¢ If a behavior analyst believes that an elderly or disabled person has been abused, neglected, or subjected to f nancial exploitation, the behavior analyst must make a report to the appropriate state agency. â¢ If a behavior analyst is requested by subpoena or court order to provide documents, they must comply. When it comes to authenticating their work, behavior analysts should be the exemplars for quality documentation. Our standard is that we take data on what we do and most ofen, we graph that data so that it can be shown to others. Tis code item reminds us that detailed intake interviews, phone conversations, and notes from client meetings need to always be documented for later use. Given the litigious nature of our current culture, it is probably wise to create a paper trail for every client so that another behavior analyst, if there was a need for a transition, could pick up the case, know exactly what you did and how you did it, and continue treatment in a seamless manner. If you begin by thinking of the material you would like to receive if someone transferred a client to you, the need for this standard will become easy to understand. Ten, of course, there are a multitude of rules and regulations as well as company policies on documentation needed for accountability purposes. One additional note is relevant here. It is a common practice of RBTs and BCBAs alike to take informal notes during therapy that are used to serve as a prompt or jog the memory of the next therapist as to tasks to complete. Tese are working documents that are not shared with clients.</p></div>

Depending on the circumstances of course, a family might need the services of a case worker, substance abuse counselor, social worker, crisis support worker, clinical psychologist, physical therapist, or speech and language pathologist. To make sure the client feels comfortable with the specialist, furnish them with a list of providers in your area, and then let them choose their specialist. We strongly discourage behavior analysts from recommending someone with whom they have a personal relationship. It is considered bad form and unethical for a behavior analyst to make a referral to a friend or colleague in exchange for a fee (known as a "kickback"). If you should engage in such a practice, it must be revealed to the client and documented in their fle.

Concerns over ethical violations by upper management, colleagues, or even supervisees or trainees may cause the behavior analyst to separate from the company as quickly as possible. Likewise, the company may feel that a behavior analyst employee has gone too far on a policy dispute or engaged in billing fraud and must be terminated immediately.

Before you contact the Board, you should meet with your attorney and explain the situation and see if you have any exposure here. Inasmuch as you were operating in good faith and that you reported this to the appropriate agency, CPS, it seems that you operated ethically.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.02 PERILS OF CONTRACTING WITH A SCHOOL DISTRICT</head><p>Following the district's guidance does not seem to be in the client's best interest. Te ethics code requires that we consider the client's (the family in this case) interest paramount. It appears that the school district's policy is to give the family the least amount of time possible to analyze the report and prepare a response to present at the meeting. Te most ethical action in this case would be for you to quickly provide the report to the family so they have adequate time to prepare their response and possibly seek legal counsel in this important matter. Behavior analysts always support the rights of clients and relevant stakeholders and operate in their best interests. Tey are not hired guns available to the highest bidder. Be aware that if you do provide the family with the report, you will likely be terminated by the school district and receive no further work from them, so be ready for this righteous consequence. As a frst step, you could show this relevant code item to your district contact to make your request stronger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.03 HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?</head><p>Tis is clearly over the recommended caseload as per the BACB Guidelines. 6 Te CEO (probably not a BCBA) may want this, but his motivation should be questioned. Te main variable here is most likely proft rather than quality care. Te caseload you are describing would put you in violation of the code and you would need to self-report your violations. Please look at page 31 of the BACB Guidelines, and you'll see that the maximum recommended is 24, assuming the BCBA has a BCaBA assisting with the cases. Constant pressure for quantity calls for equally constant pushback. Best of luck in your quest for a humane working environment.</p></div>

Te next time you are there, start with, "We need to discuss an issue that has been bothering me for a while. Can we sit down . . .?" Ten, present her with the Declaration and go through it section by section. When you get to the part on no more personal conversations (however you want to word it, including consequences if she persists, e.g., you will terminate the case), make sure the mother confrms that she knows what this means.</p><p>Tere should not just be a head nod, but actual words from her. T en, fnish the review of the document. Both you and the mother should sign two copies, and you will each keep a copy. T en say, "Okay, so I need to go work with David. I know he's antsy to get started. . . ." Te real test is for the next visit where you come in, say hello, and go straight to the client. If the mother tries to get into conversation, use some body language that says, "Stop" and remind her about the written agreement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.07 WHO IS YOUR CLIENT?</head><p>Tis example of a third-party contract came from a colleague who owns a small ABA agency and was in response to a question from the frst author about how these relationships are sorted out so that the behavior analyst can determine who their client is.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.09 THREAT ASSESSMENT</head><p>"Yes, you certainly do need informed consent from the parents to conduct this sort of assessment. Tis should not be dif cult since they are requesting the assessment. Tis does not seem to be the sort of thing that behavior analysts normally do, so you will need to include your qualifcations in your consent form. T e judge will also want to make sure that you are qualifed for this rather unusual task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.11 DOCUMENT BY THE BOOK</head><p>1. Te codes used for billing require face-to-face time with the client. Te category I codes are "bundled," which means that the reimbursement rate needs to cover pre-and postactivities, which include session note writing. 2. Taking data is an acceptable practice "as you go" during session. It's part of the one-to-one treatment sessions. 3. Tis is a tough one. Tere are certainly variations of this practice that do seem questionable. To bill during lunch, there needs to be treatment either 1:1 or group based on medical necessity, and authorization approval. It cannot be based on the intent of wanting to bill for every hour that a child is in the center. 7   In many cases, if the parents knew how little therapy their child was receiving, they would request transfer to another provider.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.12 BILL THE MAXIMUM HOURS</head><p>Undoubtedly, this practice is unethical, but it is also illegal and fraudulent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.14 RIPPLE EFFECT</head><p>It sounds like this is not to be a termination but rather a transfer of services to some other agency. It is not reasonable for them to expect you to keep providing services until they fnd another provider. You need to provide the family with a list of available providers and prepare the paperwork for a seamless transfer of therapy to the agency that they select. Giving them 30 days' notice should be suf cient.  Te BACB also established a requirement for three hours of continuing education (CEU) related to supervision per certif cation cycle. Te three-hour CEU requirement is for behavior analysts who provide supervision. Tis completely revised standard requires that behavior analysts in supervisory roles must "comply with all supervisory requirements." Before training others, they must frst make sure that the training is within their scope of competence. In addition, they must determine how many supervisees or trainees they can take on and still provide ef ective supervision. Te number of supervisees or trainees should be reported to their employer to prevent them from being overburdened. When supervisors have too many supervisees, they are likely to be inefective since they are accountable for their own supervision practices as well as the professional activities of those that they supervise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 3.15 WHEN PARENTS REFUSE TO PAY</head><p>Once they have a reasonable caseload of trainees, supervisors must provide training and supervision following the necessary requirements and using evidence-based procedures. Topics related to diversity must be included in the training. T e actual supervision consists of performance monitoring, praise and feedback, and the use of improvement plans when problems with trainees arise. Behavior analyst supervisors only delegate tasks to supervisees that they are certain they can perform and actively evaluate their supervisory practices.</p><p>If it appears that there needs to be a change of supervisors, this is done to reduce any negative impact on the supervisee. If a trainee must be terminated, the supervisor should carefully plan this action to reduce the negative impact as much as possible. Under this new standard, supervisees should expect to receive frequent direct observation and be given precise and timely feedback in such a way that it actually improves their performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A CLOSER LOOK AT RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPERVISEES AND TRAINEES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.01">Compliance with Supervision Requirements (See 1.02)</head><p>Behavior analysts are knowledgeable about and comply with all applicable supervisory requirements (e.g., BACB rules, licensure requirements, funder and organization policies), including those related to supervision modalities and structure <ref type="bibr">(e.g., in person, video conference, individual, group)</ref>.</p><p>Te amount of information that supervisors are required to have at their fngertips is daunting. Just keeping track of all the BACB forms requires an extraordinary ability to search for and rapidly retrieve the information, organize it, enter it into spreadsheets, and then provide it at just the right time. For a quick review of what is required go to BACB.com and type "Supervision" in the search box. Here you will fnd a pre-experience checklist, supervision meeting forms, newsletters with recent updates to requirements, lists of feldwork requirements, Monthly and Final Experience Verifcation Forms, a Contested Experience form, experience standards, RBT audit forms, consulting supervisor requirements, the Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline, and more. Assuming you are supervising RBTs, you will need to have read the RBT and BCaBA Handbooks. In addition, if you are practicing in a state that has licensure, you will need to review and have on f le those requirements as well. Most behavior-analytic services are now funded by government agencies or insurance companies and supervisors are required to know and keep track of all their requirements in addition to making themselves aware of the policy and procedure manual of their places of employment.</p><p>Te most strongly recommended form of supervision is by live, direct observation, whether it is in a classroom, clinic, or home or community setting. Live observation is preferred since you can see and hear everything that is going on and if necessary, provide immediate feedback to the trainee. Tis is likely to be the most efective means of performance improvement. Many supervisors, for a variety of reasons, are adopting a second-best option of live video monitoring where they can see and hear the client and therapist. However, using this modality will miss any contextual variables such as sibling or parent activity that might occurring in the vicinity. To make this modality even reasonably efective, the therapist should be equipped with a bug-in-the-ear device where the supervisor can provide prompts and feedback to encourage the therapist or suggest online changes in strategy. (See Case 4.04 for an unacceptable version of this approach). A third method, which is not recommended, is where the therapist makes a video recording of a session with a client and then sends it to their supervisor. Te delays in feedback can make this method nearly nonfunctional since by the time it is received, the therapist has no doubt moved on to other tasks. Finally, there are individual or group meetings where issues of behavior-analytic treatment or research topics are discussed and debated. While this may count as supervision, there is no research literature showing that this  Tis code item includes two separate concepts: (1) remaining within their scope of practice for supervision and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) keeping up with professional development in the area of supervision (aka acquiring supervision CEUs).</p><p>1. For this standard, the distinction between scope of practice and scope of competence is important. "Te term scope of practice is used to refer to the activities of the profession and is determined by external oversight organizations, whereas the term scope of competence is used to refer to the activities of a specif c individual and is determined by the individual practitioner." 1 To identify the scope of practice for BCBAs, in our f eld we look to the BCBA Task List. 2 While there are generic descriptions of skills in Behavior Assessment for "problem behavior" and Behavior-Change Procedures for general methods such as "use conditioned reinforcers" and "use shaping," there is no mention of specifc client behaviors that might be involved.</p><p>For "Selecting and Implementing Interventions," again there are generic skill sets listed. "Make data-based decisions about the need for ongoing services," and "state intervention goals in observable and measurable terms." Tis section implies that a person can only supervise in those skill areas on which they received their graduate training. Tis could be a narrow range of common presenting behaviors such as lack of language and social skills, some minor disruptive and non-compliant behaviors, of-task and perhaps some low-intensity aggression, and with a rather select population, very likely limited to young children with ASD diagnoses. A supervisor with this training would not be competent to supervise RBTs on cases involving any of the more difcult behaviors such as severe SIB, dangerous disruption and aggression, frequent elopement, persistent pica of non-food items, eating disorders, or hypersexual and paraphilic behaviors. Gaining competence in one of these or other areas so that one can supervise those types of cases is a fairly lengthy process involving a series of steps, as outlined in LeBlanc, Heinicke, &amp; Baker (2012). 3 T e process starts with reading the current literature and ABA research, contacting the professional group for this category of client/behavior, and then pursuing intensive training and supervision from an expert in this area and receiving the appropriate credential as documentation of this new area of competence. Supervisors should also review this document from the BCBA on "Respecializing in a New Practice Area." 4 2. Te second part of this standard requires BCBAs to complete the eight-hour Supervisor Training based on the Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0). In addition, they need to complete three CEUs on topics related to supervision in each of their recertifcation cycles. For the CEU to count, the content must be behavior-analytic in nature (presumably meeting the requirements of <ref type="bibr">Baer, Wolf, &amp; Risley, 1968</ref>). Although much is written on efective supervisor repertoires, there is very little experimental work in this area so we are lef with metaphoric extensions of work in other areas and hopeful generalizations from basic principles. Tere is also reference in this standard to "continually evaluating . . . their supervisory repertoires." Please see Code 4.10 for more on this. BCBA supervisors are reminded repeatedly in this code of ethics that they are to give top priority to "operate in the best interest of clients" (Codes 1.03, 2.10, 3.01, and 3.08). When it comes to the volume of cases to be supervised, this sometimes puts them in direct confict with the fnancial incentives of their company. Supervisory volume is one of the most critical problems in our feld at the present time. Because of the f nancial contingencies involved (the more clients admitted, the more billable hours, the better the bottom line), supervisors are being required by their employers to take on more and more cases. Tey are also being required to take on additional associated RBTs, supervisees, and trainees with little regard for the expertise of these individuals or how much time it takes with each one to guarantee quality control of behavioral services rendered. Tis standard is explicit that "ef ective supervision" is the line in the sand that must be drawn by supervisors. When supervisors feel they are no longer delivering quality supervision, it is their responsibility, your responsibility, to take the necessary steps with their company. Some indications that a supervisor is not being efective include not able to meet the 5% supervision requirement, failure to return trainee email and phone calls in a timely fashion, complaints from clients about the trainee or supervisee, apparent RBT burnout for lack of support, and questions from supervisees about their client and you have only a foggy idea of what they are talking about.</p><formula xml:id="formula_59">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>Supervisors wanting to remain ethical and in compliance with Code 4.02 must engage in a new and somewhat unfamiliar skill of pushing back against their clinical director, company CEO, or owner when they have reached their limit of cases. T is standard gives them authorization to do this and a method of self-assessment for some degree of counter-control against their administration.</p><p>A self-assessment to quantify time spent in supervision may consist of a time and motion study 5 conducted for a representative sample of time such as a week. It starts with categorizing the type of behaviors that are relevant, such as direct and indirect time with supervisees, preparation of training materials for trainees, analysis of their client data, reports of their performance, and so</p><formula xml:id="formula_60">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 4 â¢ 219</formula><p>on. Next, you will need to prepare a data sheet and set up small time bins of 10-20 minutes, in which to record your activity and have some means to keep this with you throughout the day. You should also have a timer to prompt you to make the recording. At the end of each day, you will tabulate the total amount of time spent in each activity as well as the total for all categories. Use this information to prepare an easy-to-read histogram. Do this each day, and at the end of the week, you should have a good picture of your current workload overall and by subcategory. Attach a summary statement about what this shows and assuming it proves your point about being overloaded already with supervision, you are ready to make your case to your superiors.</p></div>

Our clinic just opened within the last year, and there has been a big push to grow as quickly as possible to become fnancially sustainable. About 2 1/2 months ago, we were asked to complete a burst of initial assessments, with the promise that a third BCBA would be hired within 6 weeks to take these additional clients. It has been 2 months now, and that BCBA hasn't been hired. In a meeting with my direct supervisor (not a BCBA), I asked if a cap was going to be put on our current caseloads until another BCBA is on board. I was told that there is no limit to our current caseloads and that we will be continuing to take on all the clients in our pipeline going forward. I asked if we would be assigned more billable hours per week, to cover this increase and she said that could happen since a BCBA at another location already has a caseload of 75 billable hours per week. I asked if there were any ethical concerns regarding assigning such</p><formula xml:id="formula_61">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>large caseloads to our BCBAs, and she responded that she didn't know and would bring it up to other leaders in the company. She then ended the conversation.</p><p>"If all of the clients that I have assessed up to this point actually begin services, I will have a caseload of 40 billable hours per week, and that doesn't account for time needed for non-billable treatment activities, or billable parent consultation hours. I feel like I need to protest but I suspect my job may be on the line when I do, as I've already been told that my salary could potentially be cut if I do not bill enough.</p><p>"I have signifcant reservations about stating in my assessment reports for these clients that a particular number of behavior consultation hours are medically necessary and then having such a large caseload that it is impossible to follow through on actually providing all of those hours."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.04">Accountability in Supervision (See 1.03)</head><p>Behavior analysts are accountable for their supervisory practices. Tey are also accountable for the professional activities (e.g., client services, supervision, training, research activity, public statements) of their supervisees or trainees that occur as part of the supervisory relationship.</p><p>Accountability usually means there are consequences for failure to carry out a responsibility and there are also rewards for a job well done. Tis code item includes two separate accountable tasks: a supervisor is (1) accountable for their supervisory practices and (2) responsible for the conduct of their supervisees and trainees when they are on the job. We will deal with each separately.</p><p>Being accountable for supervisory practices means that a supervisor is providing oversight for RBTs and BCaBAs who are</p><formula xml:id="formula_62">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 4 â¢ 221</formula><p>providing behavior-analytic services and trainees who are accruing experience hours. In addition, you may be called on to train RBTs and assess their competence, provide a written contract with each supervisee and trainee, observe and meet with them regularly as required to meet the 5% minimum supervision requirement, and make sure that they are completing all their assigned billable hours accurately recorded each month.</p><p>Being held accountable for the professional conduct of trainees and supervisees is quite another matter since this can be very open-ended. With a 5% supervisory requirement, this means that trainees and supervisees are un-supervised 95% of the time. T is can be a frightening prospect especially if they are working with a child in an unstructured home environment where there may not even be an adult present. If something happens and the child reports that their therapist "touched my private parts," the supervisor can be held accountable. If a parent notices an unusual bruise or scratch, or the child says, "Mae hit me on my backside just because I spilled my juice," the supervisor is held accountable. If a nonverbal client exhibits unusual behaviors, such as crying when the therapist shows up or finching when the RBT reaches for the child's hand, the supervisor can be held to account. T is may ultimately mean that you will have to report the RBT for violating the RBT Ethics Code if your investigation shows that they were responsible for abuse of a client. Your organization may also hold you accountable for the actions of the RBT that you supervise.</p></div>

I signed in my spot as the supervisor, and returned them, then he says he signed the forms. When I asked for scanned copies, he said that was not possible.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.06">Providing Supervision and Training (See 1.02, 1.13, 2.01)</head><p>Behavior analysts deliver supervision and training in compliance with applicable requirements (e.g., BACB rules, licensure requirements, funder and organization policies). T ey design and implement supervision and training procedures that are evidence based, focus on positive reinforcement, and are individualized for each supervisee or trainee and their circumstances.</p><p>To meet this requirement, the supervisor should start by reviewing the relevant rules and regulations for supervision. T ese should have been covered in the eight-hour training and can be seen in the Supervisor Training Curriculum Outline (2.0), available at BACB.com. In addition, the BCBA Handbook is also essential reading to understand what is required to become a BCBA Supervisor which includes the following roles: (1) Supervisor , who manages RBTs and BCaBAs as well as trainees who are accruing experience hours; (2) Assessor, who conducts or evaluates students who are pursuing or trying to maintain their RBT status; this includes the Initial Competency Assessment as well as the Renewal Competency Assessment; and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref> When supervising RBTs, "you are responsible for the actions of all RBTs under your supervision" (BCBA Handbook, p. 44). Tis includes handling any ethics violations of which the RBT has been accused. Tis might include handling the incident internally as per your company's policies or by fling a Notice of Alleged Violation with the Board if it is a severe case involving client abuse or fraudulent billing.</p><p>Once an RBT has completed the 40-hour training, this does not mean that their training is complete. It is actually just the beginning. Since RBTs are in many respects the face of ABA to the public, they require training in all aspects of dealing with clients as well as parents/caregivers and stakeholders. One misstep in a conversation or the handling of a touchy question can set of a ripple efect that could turn the stakeholders against the treatment that they are receiving or against ABA in general. Te same holds for their implementation of behavioral procedures on a day-to-day basis. One accidental reinforcer could destroy a month's worth of work in reducing an inappropriate behavior, or even set the stage for the beginning of noncompliance, destruction, aggression, or SIB. Obviously, the oversight and training that an RBT receives every day and every week counts toward a successful outcome and a positive impression on parents/caregivers and stakeholders. T e model of training of RBTs is supposed to resemble that used by other professionals such as dentists, doctors, architects, and construction subcontractors. T e frst author witnessed the following incident recently during a home renovation. Te journeyman electrician said to an apprentice, "Check that circuit to make sure it is not hot." Apprentice: "Got it." A few minutes later the electrician went to the junction box to rewire a switch, grabbed a wire with his pliers and BAM! A spark few, he jumped back, and yelled, "Hey, I thought you checked that!!?? " "Oops, sorry boss, I did check it, I'm really sorry." Tis situation was a perfect metaphor for our feld. On any given day that a supervisee or trainee is not being observed by a BCBA supervisor, they could make a mistake with a tragic outcome. Leaving a child client alone for just a few minutes while they run to the restroom could result in a quick elopement out of the house, or a child fnding Clorox under the sink, or swallowing a small toy.</p><p>Supervision-in-name-only is a dangerous practice. It is easy to simply ask the supervisee, "How's it going? " and carry on a conversation about the weather. However, this is not genuine supervision which involves direct observation, feedback, practice, and more feedback until a behavior is changed suf ciently to meet the standard for that task. Supervision is a non-behavioral term.

Soon af er joining this company, I found that my new BCBA supervisor was unavailable, unprofessional, and demeaning. He spoke to clients' parents in a condescending way, using terminology he knew they would not understand. He used the same reports for my client that he had used with previous clients. In our client's reports, there were other children's names, inaccurate information about my client as well as fabricated data. He did not attend many of my scheduled supervision visits and when he did (via telehealth), he was present for only a small amount of the session. He would leave for 15-20 minutes several times throughout the sessions. I was never shown how to do any ABA-related procedures including discrete trial training, behavioral training, mand training, etc. Afer 6 months of this and several complaints to the company by our client's mother, my BCBA supervisor resigned. According to many other RBTs at the company, this had been going on with most of his clients and supervisees for years. Our supervisors were supposed to be giving us assignments and teaching us using a specifc curriculum designed for this program, and my supervisor did none of that. Including topics related to diversity in supervision and training represents an additional requirement with true practical application. In their daily work, supervisees and trainees will no doubt encounter individuals who are diferent from them. T ey will interact with people with diferent ideas about behavior and ways of changing it. Rather than immediately reject someone's opinions or suggestions, behavior analysts should be prepared to listen and try to understand where a person is coming from regardless of their race, age, sexual orientation, and so forth. Supervisors need to provide background information for their trainees so that they are prepared to work cooperatively with others of dif erent backgrounds, showing no prejudice or bias but rather mutual respect. Unconscious bias is another topic that supervisors will want to explore with their trainees as a way of accepting all individuals without allowing possible stereotypes creep into their interactions. Perhaps most importantly, from a practical standpoint, supervisors will need to provide prompting and feedback to their trainees and supervisees on any conduct they observe that exhibits bias, insensitivity, or intolerance toward others in the workplace or with their clinical cases. Tis standard overlaps considerably with 4.06 in essentially calling for behavior shaping of supervisees and trainees and the documentation of the training. Tis code describes briefy the nature of that process. It says to use "formal praise and feedback." T is means the feedback is not "informal" as in "You're doing f ne, Tifany; keep up the good work." Te term "formal" generally means written down, shared with the individual, and kept in a f le for future reference.</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 4 â¢ 227</formula></div>

Anyone who has had a home renovation has probably noticed that carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and painters almost always have a "second" who is learning the trade. In a home renovation that spanned several months, the authors noticed that these trainees receive 100% supervision. In these cases, the "master" carpenter is constantly showing the apprentice how to approach tasks, what tools they will need, tips to make a job go more smoothly and, of course, how to remain safe and cautious in the case of coming across electrical wiring.</p><formula xml:id="formula_69">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 4 â¢ 231</formula><p>In behavior analysis, supervisees and trainees work in a similar capacity, except that they only receive 5% supervision. Although 5% this is the of cial minimum, it has become the de facto maximum. In the case of tradespersons, they will have so much daily contact with their assistant that they can easily tell if they are ready to tackle a task on their own, and since they are nearly always providing direct observation, they can provide immediate corrective feedback if necessary. In behavior analysis, determining whether a supervisee or trainee is ready to take on a delegated task is much more dif cult. Te supervisee may have seen a short video on how a token economy works (RBT Skill Acquisition C-12) 6 and may have read an article on it, but the question, "Are you ready to implement the token economy for Ms. Stephens class?" is more complex than it seems. Te supervisee is under pressure to say "Yes," but that does not mean they are equipped for this rather complex task. It is almost certain that the BCBA supervisor has not directly trained them to do this and thus has no knowledge of their skill set in this area. If they had trained this skill and observed the RBT setting up and running two or three token economies, then the supervisor would be in a position to "confrm" that the apprentice is ready. Much needs to be done to successfully execute Code 4.09 for all the tasks that a supervisee or trainee must do on a daily basis.</p></div>

My major concern was that they primarily hire RBTs who are graduate students since they are allowed to 'case manage' clients. Each RBT has three clients to manage. A BCBA meets with the RBT/grad students once a month, directly observes for about an hour, and provides consultation on programing. No assessments were conducted on any of these clients. T e RBTs</p><formula xml:id="formula_70">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>would just choose goals they felt would help the client, and the goals were rarely updated because no extra time was given to the RBTs for this task. One client eloped from the building into an extremely busy street, and no BCBA was in the building during this time. Only three people were on site that were certifed in the company's crisis prevention program and they were providing direct care with their clients. Tis deliberately put clients in danger. Is there a way to report a company?"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.10">Evaluating Efects of Supervision and Training (See 1.03, 2.17, 2.18)</head><p>Behavior analysts actively engage in continual evaluation of their own supervisory practices using feedback from others and client and supervisee or trainee outcomes. Behavior analysts document those self-evaluations and make timely adjustments to their supervisory and training practices as indicated.</p><p>We take "continual evaluation" to mean at least weekly or monthly measures of supervision efectiveness, where "efectiveness" is measured by the progress of their supervisees toward some standard of excellence. Tis would require constant monitoring of quantifable supervisee performance and the implementation of BST, or at least feedback, and some demonstration of improvement in key variables over time. Te supervisor would essentially be conducting an A, B, C, D experimental design, where each condition might be a diferent form of intervention to improve the supervisee's performance. Presumably, each trainee would have their own individualized DVs based on an assessment at the beginning of the supervisory experience and further, these would be described in the supervision contract. Tis is no mean feat given that supervisors may have 10 to 20 supervisees (Code 4.03 for recommended supervisory volume).</p><p>Another approach to evaluate the efects of supervision would be to measure the improvement in the repertoires of the clients</p><formula xml:id="formula_71">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 4 â¢ 233</formula><p>with whom the trainees work. Tis would follow a similar pattern as above except that each client that each supervisee worked with would have half a dozen or so DVs to monitor. To be practical, the trainee would track and graph this data and present it to their supervisor. Tere could be some pressure on the supervisee to always show progress with their clients so there would need to be occasional IOA checks to keep everyone honest.</p><p>Tese two types of evaluation meet the standard of being behavior-analytic and evidence-based procedures. It can be quite difcult to keep track of the skills of all the supervisees and trainees that a BCBA might have, to know which ones need remedial training and those that just need occasional reinforcers to maintain their high-quality work. For this, we recommend a behavioranalytic dashboard shown in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.1, such as those that are used in project management. 7   One fnal approach to the self-evaluation of supervisors is for the supervisor to call on a peer or one of their supervisors to observe them directly, or review the above-described data collection process and provide feedback, to which they would respond in some meaningful way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.11">New -Facilitating Continuity of Supervision (See 1.03, 2.02, 3.14) Behavior analysts minimize interruption or disruption of supervision and make appropriate and timely eforts to facilitate the continuation of supervision in the event of planned interruptions (e.g., temporary leave) or unplanned interruptions (e.g., illness, emergencies). When an interruption or disruption occurs, they communicate to all relevant parties the steps being taken to facilitate continuity of supervision.</head><p>Tis is another important addition to the ethics code for behavior analyst supervisors. Te concern here is that if there is an interruption or disruption of supervision (e.g., supervisor quits,  </p><formula xml:id="formula_72">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 4 â¢ 235</formula><p>is transferred, or is on leave for some period), clients could be adversely afected by the lack of services. If there is no supervisor, there are no RBTs, and that means there is no behavior programming. Individual behavior-analyst supervisors are thus cautioned to be fully aware of any situations coming up that might cause such an interruption and report this immediately to their clinical director. In fact, this new standard would appear to be most appropriate as a prompt for those BCBAs who are clinical directors to stay in very close touch with all of their supervisors so that they receive sufcient warning of any impending disruptions of the smooth running of their operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 4.11 CONTINUITY LOST</head><p>"Here is my situation at my company. One BCBA will be leaving on Friday. She had already given her three-week notice.

T is obviously creates a lapse in supervisor coverage, and the RBTs that remain at the clinic cannot practice alone. T e assistant director threatened my current supervisor, saying she needed to extend her notice 2 additional weeks to allow for the transition of clients to the new BCaBA. Since a BCaBA cannot stand on their own for 2 weeks, waiting for the new BCBA this makes no sense. She also threatened that she would report her to the BACB for client abandonment, among other things if she did not extend her time.

Tey document all actions taken in this circumstance and the eventual outcomes.</head><p>This new standard describes the steps that BCBAs need to take when they have determined that they need to terminate the supervision of an RBT, supervisee, or trainee. The first step in this process is for the supervisor to review the contract they created for the supervisee and examine the conditions under which the contract can be terminated. This can be problematic if the behavior analyst failed to include any language regarding conditions for termination. Since there are a wide variety of reasons for cessation, it is hard to anticipate them all, so there may be loopholes in the written document. In this case, the supervisor is left with a very uncomfortable decision, which is to keep the trainee in place and create a plan of correction with the problem behavior, or let the person go and risk being reported. In some cases, the nature of the conduct of the supervisee may be so egregious (e.g., client abuse, billing fraud, harassment of colleagues) that the person needs to be dismissed immediately following a determination of guilt and proper documentation of the offenses.</p><p>Another frequent circumstance has to do with erratic supervisee behavior, where the supervisee skips supervision sessions, fails to make performance corrections despite repeated feedback, or displays disrespectful behavior toward their supervisor and then suddenly disappears without notice. Months later the supervisee contacts the supervisor asking for signatures on a Monthly or Final Experience form, which the supervisor is reluctant to provide given the circumstances of the departure.</p><p>In some organizations, supervisees and trainees are required to sign a contract specifying that they will receive "free" supervision on condition that they will stay with the organization for two years once they pass the BCBA exam. Ofen in the fne print is a clause stating that the trainee will be required to pay a fee amounting to thousands of dollars for all of the hours of supervision they have received should they decide to quit before taking the exam or change their mind about working for the company based on the poor quality of "supervision" that they received. T is negative impact inficted by the organization on the naive supervisee will make it very difcult for the supervisor to meet the requirements of this standard, to wit, "develop a plan for terminating supervision that minimizes negative impacts to the supervisee or trainee."</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 238 â¢ Ethics Standards</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PREVIEW TO RESPONSIBILITY IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS</head><p>Tis standard introduces the requirements for behavior analysts when they are making public statements about their clients. T is might be in conference presentations or in webinars, or on a private or corporate website or a publication. A client's personal information also includes documentation related to behavioral assessment or treatment. Under this code item, the stakeholders related to the client also have a right to privacy as do trainees and supervisees with whom the behavior analyst is working. T is right to privacy is also extended to confdential information that a BCBA might have been privy to in conversations with clients or stakeholders or overheard while they were nearby. Tis is similar to the attorney-client privilege concept that is extended to include behavior analysts. In conference presentations, behavior analysts are advised to keep their accounts of clinical and research f ndings truthful and to not embellish the outcomes. Tey must also remember not to recommend treatments for someone when they are in a public forum. Behavior analysts are responsible for those who speak for them and promote their work, they must comply with intellectual property (IP) laws including copyright and trademarks. If a behavior analyst were to become involved with non-behavioral services, they must keep this separate from their behavioral work so as not to confuse the public. T ose BCBAs involved in eforts to increase their customer base may not solicit testimonials from current clients. Unsolicited reviews are exempt from this. If behavior analysts seek endorsements from former clients, they must use a disclaimer about the limiting conditions of the testimonial. In some cases, supportive statements are intended to educate the public or they are used for fundraising, in which case they are allowed with some restrictions. When using "social media channels" or websites behavior analysts must be careful not to violate client confdentiality and privacy. T ey should make every efort to ensure on professional sites that they have obtained informed consent and that they have used appropriate settings to reduce the probability that someone else can reproduce the information. In public statements, such as in conference presentations, webinars, podcasts and even videos, behavior analysts have an obligation to protect client conf dentiality including monitoring their employing organization to make sure they do the same.</p></div>

Behavior analysts prioritize the rights of their clients in all public statements.</p><p>T is new standard requires behavior analysts "protect</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clients rights include a</head><p>the rights" of their clients basic right to privacy, which Public statements are those that are meant to be received by "the public body" as opposed to comments, opinions, or observations made in private, in closed meetings, or within "the conf nes of a company." 2 Such public statements might include those made in print, in public presentations such as talks at conferences, classroom lectures, published materials, and of course on social media. Social media is where most violations of this code will likely occur since it is so readily accessible and is a place that people like to share what they are doing. It is in this vein that they may carelessly drop the name of a client or possibly stakeholders that they are working with, or post a photo with their arm around a favorite client, or a family photo including a client taken at a picnic or birthday party or another celebration or event.</p><p>In summary, behavior analysts are put on notice that they have an obligation to protect the rights of clients, stakeholders, trainees, and supervisees including their right to privacy in all public statements. If a behavior analyst does not do this, they are in violation of our code of ethics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.02">Confdentiality in Public Statements (See 2.3, 2.04, 3.10)</head><p>In all public statements, behavior analysts protect the confdentiality of their clients, supervisees, and trainees, except when allowed. Tey make appropriate eforts to prevent accidental or inadvertent sharing of confdential or identifying information.</p><p>We discussed the importance of respecting privacy in Code 5.01. Code 5.02 now raises the question of conf dentiality, so what is the diference? As described previously, "privacy" is a right protected by law, whereas confdentiality is a matter of ethics. 3 A common expression for this is "doctor-patient conf dentiality" or "attorney-client privilege," and in this code, there is a corresponding "behavior analyst-client privilege." In the ordinary course of working with clients, they may divulge certain information that they certainly do not want shared ("Don't tell anyone, but I'm getting a divorce"), or a trainee/supervisee may reveal that they need time of since they are having a medical procedure of a very personal nature. Behavior analysts working with in-home clients will undoubtably overhear conversations or someone talking on their cell phone. It has to be totally clear, this is conf dential, not to be discussed with anyone unless you have consent or are required to by court order. Te damage to the person that could occur as a result of divulging this information is incalculable and if you were responsible, you could be liable. Te best way to prevent sharing of this information is basically to never discuss it with anyone. We understand this is totally against the tsunami of gossip, rumors, and scandalmongering that passes for entertainment in our culture, but as a professional, participating in this is clearly wrong in addition to being a violation of our code of ethics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.03">Public Statements by Behavior Analysts (See 1.01, 1.02)</head><p>When providing public statements about their professional activities, or those of others with whom they are af liated, behavior analysts take reasonable precautions to ensure that the statements are truthful and do not mislead or exaggerate either because of what they state, convey, suggest, or omit; and are based on existing research and a behavioral conceptualization. Behavior analysts do not provide specif c advice related to a client's needs in public forums.</p><p>We have provided a defnition of "public statements" in Code 5.01, and that applies to this code as well. In this code item, behavior analysts are warned to be careful in how they describe what they do as a professional, making sure they do not exaggerate their skills or expertise or mislead the public as to their status or their therapy outcomes. Te most signifcant problem we have in this area involves behavior analysts hinting or claiming that their interventions can "cure" autism. Tis gives parents, caregivers, and stakeholders false hope and almost certainly sets them up for a signifcant disappointment and quite possibly disenchantment with our f eld. Te claim of a cure is without a doubt an exaggeration, since the best applied research available suggests that many symptoms can be reduced and ef ective replacement skills taught, but there is no ABA research showing a cure.</p><p>Another frequent issue is misrepresentation of a person's credential status. An RBT who has completed all the coursework and all of the supervision hours but has not yet taken the BCBA test is still an RBT and cannot tell clients, "I'm a soon-to-be BCBA" or "nearly BCBA" or "For all practical purposes, I'll be your BCBA on this case." Te BACB has a helpful job aid to help understand this problem (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">10</ref>.1).</p><p>One fnal common violation of this code item includes a situation where a behavior analyst is conducting a call-in radio show, webinar, or webcast, taking questions from the audience and trying to give behavioral advice. "I'm just at my wits end with my 5-year-old," says Sandy from Toledo. "He eats anything he f nds on the foor and I've even caught him digging around the kitchen garbage can. We have scolded him, sent him to his room, and even spanked him, nothing works. Can you please give me some advice?" Te ethical BCBA should not respond by describing how mom can treat pica at home, but rather provide some general advice such as, "T e frst thing to do, Sandy, is to have your son seen by your pediatrician. Tis sounds like it could be a medical issue. If he is cleared with no medical indications, I would say the next thing would be to contact a Board Certifed Behavior Analyst who can visit you at your home and try and determine what the environmental cause might be."</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">10</ref>.1 What to say instead of "BCBA pending" or "BCBA candidate," etc. 4   Another example of adhering to this standard is for the behavior analyst to make general comments relating back to the treatment literature on possible treatment options. Say, for example, the neighbor of a behavior analyst starts a conversation at a cocktail party about their child and her sleeping problem. Instead of asking specifc questions about the situation in order to provide specifc advice, the behavior analyst could talk about resources that</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 5 â¢ 253</formula><p>the parent could go to regarding a behavioral approach for sleep problems, such as Dr. Pat Friman's Good Night, Sweet Dreams, I Love You: Now Get Into Bed and Go to Sleep. 5 For more general behavior problems, we recommend Changing Children's Behavior by Changing People, Places and Activities in T eir Lives. 6</p></div>

You can request to look at drafs of promotional materials and do your best to provide alternate language that more correctly describes behavior analysis services. It is important to provide your feedback in writing and to maintain these documents if problems arise in the future. You may not succeed, but if you try, you will get credit for standing by our code of ethics.</p></div>

I have read Code 5.04 and feel that these marketing promotions should wait until the VCS is approved and the courses are ready for delivery.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.05">Use of Intellectual Property (See 1.01, 1.02, 1.03) Behavior analysts are knowledgeable about and comply with intellectual property laws, including obtaining permission to use materials that have been trademarked or copyrighted or can otherwise be claimed as another's intellectual property as defned by law. Appropriate use of such materials includes providing citations, attributions, and/or trademark or copyright symbols. Behavior analysts do not unlawfully obtain or disclose proprietary information, regardless of how it became known to them.</head><p>As it turns out, intellectual property laws are a little complicated so remaining in compliance with them can be a challenge. T ese laws encompass everything from copyrights to patents and trademarks to trade secrets and there are rules and laws for each category. 7 Te purpose of intellectual property and the laws that go with it is to encourage people to create "intellectual goods" and gives them an incentive to do so for the beneft of themselves, society, and the business sector. If there was no protection for their ideas, the incentive to be creative would disappear and our culture would likely stagnate. Goldstein and Reese have summed it up this way: "Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law." 8 Te two types of laws that you need to be especially knowledgeable of are copyright and trademark.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Copyright Â©</head><p>In general, copyrights protect various kinds and types of written and other artistic works. 9 Tey give you legal rights to anything you create that expresses an idea. With a copyright, you have exclusive rights "to copy, distribute, reproduce, display, and license the work." 10 If you discover the Â© symbol on an article or book, that means that you need to request permission from the holder of the copyright before you make copies. Te penalties for infringing on someone's copyright can be severe with f nes ranging from $200 to $150,000 plus the cost of attorney fees and court costs. Te "infringer" can actually go to jail under some circumstances. 11 What if you fnd some copyrighted material and want to use it? Tis is where it gets complicated. Te best thing to do is to contact the owner of the copyright and ask for permission to make copies. Be sure to do this in writing and get their permission in writing. Under some circumstances, you may not need permission. For example, if the material is in the public domain (be sure to read up on this, as there are details involved) or if it has been designated by the author as Creative Commons (look this up too before you copy anything), permission may not be needed. One fnal thing to know is that under some circumstances, you may be able to make limited copies for use in a presentation or a blog post under a category called fair use (again, do your research on this before proceeding). 12</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trademark TM</head><p>In general, trademarks protect a name or symbol that specif es where products or services originate. 13 Words, symbols, colors, or even sounds can be trademarked. If you see the â¢ symbol, it means that this work has been trademarked and you may not use it in any of your promotional material. Te owner of a trademark can protect their rights by having their attorney send a cease and desist letter to the violator and if that does not stop the infringement, they can fle a lawsuit with penalties up to $150,000 plus court costs and attorney fees plus prison time in some circumstances. 14  Tis code also mentions "proprietary" information, which is another way of saying conf dential information. T is might include fnancial data such as billing, payroll or expenses or, marketing plans or materials, as well as any unique assessments or treatment documents or protocols that an ABA company might have developed and do not want shared with other agencies. 15 It would not be unusual for a company to ask new employees to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) when they are hired that covers any of this proprietary information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.06">New -Advertising Nonbehavioral Services (See 1.01, 1.02, 2.01)</head><p>Behavior analysts do not advertise nonbehavioral services as behavioral services. If behavior analysts provide nonbehavioral services, those services must be clearly distinguished from their behavioral services and BACB certif cation with the following disclaimer: "Tese interventions are not behavioral in nature and are not covered by my BACB certif cation." Tis disclaimer is placed alongside the names and descriptions of all nonbehavioral interventions. If a behavior analyst is employed by an organization that violates this Code standard, the behavior analyst makes reasonable ef orts to remediate the situation, documenting all actions taken and the eventual outcomes. Some behavior analysts may see a contradiction in this standard. On one hand, we are able to "provide services that are conceptually consistent with behavioral principles" (Code 2.01). Later, we learn that behavior analysts can "implement nonbehavioral services" (Code 2.01), even though this would involve violating Core Principle 4, "Remaining within the profession's scope of practice." In Code 5.06, we learn that behavior analysts are allowed to advertise these nonbehavioral services if they distinguish them from regular, behavioral, evidence-based procedures. Te disclaimer is quite clear, but there is still a good chance that consumers will be confused. Tus, this code item obligates us to clearly disseminate this information in a way to minimize confusion on the part of the consumer. Finally, if a behavior analyst works at a company that advertises the availability of nonbehavioral interventions on their website, they need to go on the record as trying to correct this misdeed (e.g., the agency did not include the disclaimer and the ethical BCBA pushes to have it added to the website).</p><p>Staying with the intent of Core Principle 4 and "remaining within the profession's scope of practice"; that is, using only evidence-based behavioral procedures is best practice.

Specifcally, we believe that behavior is infuenced by the environment, or as Dr. Pat Friman would say, "Te Circumstances View" <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Friman, 2021)</ref>, and not by some mystical universal energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 5.06 BCBA BELIEVES IN REIKI</head><p>"I just discovered a website describing a new business run by a BCBA that is advertising that they use ABA, ACT, and 'Reiki healing.' Reiki is a 'Japanese form of alternative medicine called energy healing' where 'universal energy' is said to be transferred through the palms of the person's hands to encourage emotional or physical healing.' 16 T is seems well out of the scope of practice as described in our code of ethics and there is no disclaimer. Is this something that should be reported to the Board?" 5.07 New -Soliciting Testimonials From Current Clients for Advertising (See 1.11, 1.13, 2.11, 3.01, 3.10) Because of the possibility of undue infuence and implicit coercion, behavior analysts do not solicit testimonials from current clients or stakeholders for use in advertisements designed to obtain new clients. Tis does not include unsolicited reviews on websites where behavior analysts cannot control content, but such content should not be used or shared by the behavior analyst. If a behavior analyst is employed by an organization that violates this Code standard, the behavior analyst makes reasonable eforts to remediate the situation, documenting all actions taken and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>"Solicit" seems like such a strong term. It suggests "calling attention to one's wants or desires by public announcement," 17 and it may conjure up unseemly images when other terms such as urge, request, or ask are available. Basically, what this standard is trying to establish is that you should not even ask current clients (or stakeholders) for a testimonial that is designed to lure in new clients because of the implicit coercion. Current clients might feel they could lose services, receive poorer quality services, if they choose not to give the testimonial. Alternately, on the incentive side, clients giving testimonials may believe they stand a chance of receiving additional hours, being assigned a more senior therapist, or even receiving additional resources in exchange for their "complimentary" testimonial.</p><p>If someone including a current client, former client, or stakeholder posts a testimonial on your website, this means your website is not set up to exclude public comments. Your professional website should be set up to exclude public comments. T is is something you can push for with your administration since a public comment constitutes a testimonial even if received unsolicited. Tis constitutes a violation of the code of ethics if the website is managed by a behavior analyst. If your organization asks current clients for testimonials, you need to put your concerns in writing to management stating that you disagree with this tactic and that it is a violation of your code of ethics. See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">10</ref>.2 for the dos and don'ts of testimonials.</p><p>Four fnal comments about testimonials seem to be warranted here. First, while testimonials have face validity to the average consumer, it is clear they are ofen used by organizations of ering alternative treatments. Practitioners touting non-evidence-based treatments do this since they do not have hard data on the ef ectiveness of their approach. When a behavior-analytic company begins posting testimonials, it makes us appear to be just like these other agencies, perhaps even equivalent to them in the eyes of the consumer. Going testimonial-less makes it clear that we are dif erent. Second, to the discriminating consumer, the question arises, "Who actually wrote this? It sounds like something a marketing person would write," which is certainly legitimate since there is no way to verify if the testimonial is accurate, exaggerated, or even created out of whole cloth. Tird, if a company did send out a request for testimonials, would they publish all of them including those from dissatisfed clients or stakeholders? Probably not, and if that is the case, then there would be a clear misrepresentation of customer satisfaction involved in this process. In addition, if testimonials are used for advertising purposes, they must comply with FTC truth-in-advertising guidelines, including the following question, "Are letters from satisfed customers suf cient</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 5 â¢ 261</formula><p>to substantiate a claim?

Notice that there are no exceptions, so we take this to mean no photos, no names, and no identifying information that would allow an outsider to guess who the identity of the clients. Another social media rule would have to do with putting client information on a professional account or website. Tis means the company social media or web page or, if a behavior analyst is a consultant, it would include the organization's page. For a professional/company account, the four requirements of 5.10 are strong and clear:</p><p>1. Obtain informed consent (be sure to review the eight steps that are required for this; see p. 7 of the code). 2. Include a disclaimer that informed consent was achieved and an instruction to readers that forbids capturing and using the information is included. 3. Do your posting on social media in such a way that it "reduces the potential for sharing," which means looking for settings that can be used to reducing the ability of the viewer to copy and send around on the internet. 4. Try to prevent viewers from misusing the information. Make corrections if this happens, and document everything.</p></div>

Tey ensure that all shared media is accompanied by a disclaimer indicating that informed consent was obtained. If a behavior analyst is employed by an organization that violates this Code standard, the behavior analyst makes reasonable eforts to remediate the situation, documenting all actions taken and the eventual outcomes.</p><p>Since almost all content these days is digital, this standard basically applies to all public statements regarding clients or stakeholders that an agency might publish in any format or medium. As established in 5.01, this includes the client's name, photograph, address, diagnosis, status, behavioral data, and all other documentation related to assessment or treatment. When informed consent is presented to the client, we also presume that the risks involved (item 4 of informed consent, p. 7) 21 in allowing their information to go public are clearly presented. Some of these risks include identity thef, phishing, catf shing, cyberbullying, discrimination, hacking, and fraud. 22 It should also be pointed out that the benef ts to the client are quite limited. A disclaimer with wording something like, "Tis client freely allowed us access to their information, gave us permission to share it in <ref type="bibr">[document]</ref> and was fully apprised of the risks involved via our informed consent process." It is now standard practice that the behavior analyst is required to inform their company if there is a violation, try to remedy it, and document all of their attempts to do so.</p></div>

Tis photo could be considered conf dential information since the client would be easy to identify, so this would be a violation. In keeping with the guidance on page 5 of the Ethics Code, "Behavior analysts should address concerns about the professional misconduct of others directly with them when, afer assessing the situation, it seems possible that doing so will resolve the issue and not place the behavior analyst or others at undue risk." You should take this up with the BCBA who committed this infraction. Even though they may be working primarily as consultants or behavioral assistants, there will be times when practicing behavior analysts may fnd themselves in graduate programs or courses where they will be involved in the design and carrying out of a research project <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Bailey &amp; Burch, 2018)</ref>. Ethical considerations are of utmost importance when conducting research, and, in most cases, the ethical issues will be overseen by institutional review boards (IRBs) that are in place to approve, monitor, and review research. Te primary role of IRBs is to protect the welfare of human research participants, and this ethics code provides an additional level of specifcity regarding ethics.</p><p>Te standards included in this chapter explain that frst of all, research must be conducted according to local laws and regulations and only afer formal approval by an IRB. Some behavior analysts may be conducting research on service-delivery systems, and in these cases, they must follow ethics requirements for both that service and the IRB. Behavior analyst researchers always obtain informed consent from participants and a second informed consent to publish the data, making sure that the release of the information will not afect the services. Protecting the confdentiality of research participants is a high priority, as is preventing any accidental sharing of their information. It is important that behavior analysts are well prepared before they undertake an independent research venture, including having completed a thesis or dissertation or some other supervised research project.</p><p>Tose who undertake such projects should know that they are responsible for any ethical problems that might arise due to their assistants. Researchers have a particular responsibility to disclose any conficts of interest (whether fnancial or service related) that they might have and must disclose any publication conf icts that they might have. At some point, when the research is completed, and authorship is to be determined, behavior analyst researchers exhibit integrity by giving appropriate credit to all contributors, acknowledging the contributions of each individual. Also related to publication of fndings researchers do not copy and use someone else's work and present it as their own. Once a piece of research is completed and the data published, researchers follow the required standards for storing and destroying raw data and other documents. Retention of digital copies may be permitted under some circumstances. Finally, behavior analyst researchers always truthfully report their results as well as their methodology in such a way that it can be replicated by other labs. When presenting the data in talks or journal articles they include all the data. If for some reason some f ndings must be excluded, this must be explained and the rationale given.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.01">Conforming with Laws and Regulations in Research</head><p>Behavior analysts plan and conduct research in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as requirements by organizations and institutions governing research activity.</p><p>Research is extremely important to our feld. Since the beginning, behavior analysis has produced well-designed research studies, whose fndings (both in the experimental and applied camps) have dramatically expanded what we know about human behavior. Tis knowledge has been put to good use to improve many aspects of the human condition in diverse felds of application (e.g., sports, mental health, behavioral medicine, education, special education, and animal training). Tus, research activity is in the DNA of our f eld.</p><p>Behavior analysts who conduct research in their particular areas of interest have many obligations to fulfll to do their research in a legally appropriate way. Primarily, they must be aware of and be sure to meet all requirements for conducting research that might be established by their agency, state, federal, and other regulatory bodies. Tese layers of oversight could be many. For example, the agency where the behavior analyst researcher works may have its own particular policies for doing research at that agency. It is common for human service agencies to have a human rights committee (HRC) or something similar that is authorized to review any application for research to be conducted at that agency. T e HRC exists to protect the human rights and dignity of the individuals being served at the agency, and to ensure that any research activity involving participants at that agency does not conf ict with the clinical outcomes for the individuals. Tus, the behavior analyst typically will propose their research study to the HRC for its approval. If approved, that would mean the committee views the research proposal as sufciently protecting the rights of the potential participants, that the research question is reasonable for the mission of the agency, and that the individual is likely to beneft in some way from participating in the research.</p><p>In addition, most (if not all) states will have some regulatory body that sets standards for conducting research within the state</p><formula xml:id="formula_84">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 276 â¢ Ethics Standards</formula><p>boundaries. For example, states may have a board that governs the licensing of behavior analysts. Such an organization may have specifc research legal and ethical standards to which the behavior analyst must attend. Finally, at the federal level, there are of en standards published for pursuing research and maintain legal boundaries. For example, Health and Human Services (HHS) has an Of ce for Human Research Protections (OHRP). 1 T is ofce has important resources for the behavioral researcher, including legal standards (particularly 45 CRF 46), 2 training on research standards, and ethics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.01 CEASE AND DESIST</head><p>A BCBA worked at a local agency serving children with autism spectrum disorders. He was working there to defray tuition costs at the local university, where he was enrolled in a doctoral program in behavior analysis. T is BCBA planned on doing his PhD research at this agency and submitted an application to the university's IRB for its review of his proposal. Afer a few weeks, the IRB notifed the BCBA that his research application was accepted. Elated, he then began distributing recruitment letters and fyers to every family who had a child attending that particular agency. However, the day afer the f rst letters went out to families, he received a phone call from the agency's HRC, ordering him to cease advertising his research until it was reviewed by the HRC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.02">Research Review (See 1.02, 1.04, 3.01)</head><p>Behavior analysts conduct research, whether independent of or in the context of service delivery, only af er approval by a formal research review committee.</p><p>Before a behavior analyst can begin a research study, they must submit their proposed study for a review of its quality by a committee that is independent of the researcher. T is external review typically comes in the form of an IRB. IRBs are usually associated with universities. Another external review body is an HRC, which is ofen part of human-service agencies.</p><p>Te purpose of these external review committees is to ensure the basic human rights of participants who served as subjects in the research. Te review committee is obligated to carefully review the research application to look for protection of the physical and psychological welfare of individuals who are participants in such studies. Sadly, the necessity of these committees came about due to gross violation of basic human rights in research that has been carried out over the decades. A well-known example is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, 3 in which African American males were recruited for a study to observe the efects of untreated syphilis. Te researchers told the participants that they were receiving free health care from the federal government when, in fact, no such health care was given. Te participants were told that their involvement would last 6 months; however, it was extended to 40 years. Te lack of ethical standards was blatant and terrifying. T e eventual exposure of this travesty led to the establishment of the OHRP, which sets standards for examining the extent to which researchers maintain protection of their subjects.</p><p>Te research review committees focus on two primary protections: protection from physical harm and protection from psychological harm. Te researcher must demonstrate, through their methods and procedures, that the participants are engaging in activities that are safe, humane, and ethical, and that the research activities do not put them in potential physical danger. Researchers must also be considerate of potential psychological sufering, such as deceptive practices and undue pressure in any form. Te potential for harm can sometimes be quite subtle. For example, let's say a BCBA is recruiting potential subjects for a research study focusing on classroom management. Part of the intervention methodology consists of contingency management, which, in this proposal, is manifested by the researcher publicly</p><formula xml:id="formula_85">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 278 â¢ Ethics Standards</formula><p>reprimanding a student who engages in inappropriate behavior during individual seatwork time. Te research review committee may question this practice, since it is conceivable that by publicly reprimanding this behavior, the student in question might be embarrassed in front of his classmates, which could easily upset him. Te research review committee would likely question the researcher as to why this particular contingency needs to be put in place, and the potential danger to the student for humiliation.</p><p>Tese review committees review the proposed research study. If the committee concludes that the research activities will not put the subject at unusual harm, approval is given to conduct the research. If the committee foresees the potential for physical or psychological harm to the subjects, the committee will require the researcher to modify the procedures to remove the potential, or to outright decline to approve the project.</p></div>

She was also attending a local college, where she was earning a second master's degree in mental health counseling. T is BCBA had a particular interest in applying behavior analytic thinking <ref type="bibr">(and training)</ref> to the issue of children of divorced parents. Many of these children display adjustment problems, and behavioral strategies (e.g., reinforcement, self-management, and prompting) have been shown to be benefcial in promoting healthy behavior. T is BCBA has developed a research proposal for studying this very topic. Part of her proposal is to interview grown children of divorced parents, to gain insight and information regarding how they themselves reacted to their parents divorcing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.03">Research in Service Delivery (See 1.02, 1.04, 2.01, 3.01)</head><p>Behavior analysts conducting research in the context of service delivery must arrange research activities such that client services and client welfare are prioritized. In these situations, behavior analysts must comply with all ethics requirements for both service delivery and research within the Code. When professional services are ofered as an incentive for research participation, behavior analysts clarify the nature of the services, and any potential risks, obligations, and limitations for all parties.</p><p>Behavior analysts ofen conduct research involving clinical populations in clinical settings, focusing on issues of clinical importance, such as learning outcomes and behavior problems that may interfere with learning. In such situations, the behavior analyst must fulfll both obligations of ethical and legal research and must also comply with ethical requirements regarding clinical practice. One of the frst questions to address is, will the research question contribute to the client welfare? Tis relates to two levels. First, will participation in the research directly result in the specif c client improving in some way that is important to the client? T e second level relates to a wider impact, say, to the f eld at large, to children more generally, and to other populations. Te aims of the research project must, whenever possible, relate positively to the populations who will be used as participants.</p><p>When doing research in the context of service delivery, behavior analysts must be aware of the extent to which research activities might compete and interfere with clinical services and the accomplishment of client goals. A simple example consists of whether the activity in the research protocol might detract from the number of hours the client receives therapy. If, say, the research protocol requires a child to be in the research activities one hour a day, that is f ve hours a week that the child will not be receiving clinical services. Will this loss of services have a negative impact on goal attainment? Te behavioral researcher needs to be aware of this and either avoid reducing clinical hours or be able to ofer a strong justifcation for impacting on the clinical services.</p><p>On some occasions, a behavior analyst might propose conducting research in a clinical setting, and ofers to provide specifc clinical services as a "thank you" for the agency permitting the research to take place at that location. For example, if a particular research study focused on some aspect of functional analysis (FA), then the researcher might propose that af er the study is completed, the behavior analyst would conduct some clinical (FAs) for the agency for a limited time under limited conditions. Our code permits this quid pro quo, but only when the conditions for such professional services are clearly laid out for all to understand. In the example above, the researcher would need to specify the conditions under which functional analyses would be conducted as part of this incentive program. Questions such as these would need to be addressed: How many students would receive FAs? How many weeks and months would the researcher provide such a service? How many people would the researcher make available to the agency to conduct these assessments? Is there a set of criteria for selecting a child to obtain an FA? Setting up such incentive contracts are helpful and can lead to more research being conducted, but the diffculty and care that must occur to completely delineate such services can be complex.</p><p>that data obtained from past or current clients, stakeholders , supervisees, and/or trainees during typical service delivery might be disseminated to the scientifc community, they obtain informed consent for use of the data before dissemination, specify that services will not be impacted by providing or withholding consent, and make available the right to withdraw consent at any time without penalty.</p><p>Te importance of informed consent cannot be overstated. Researchers have a legal and moral obligation to fully inform potential subjects about what they are getting into before they agree to participate. Tere are several concepts involved in informed consent. First, consent must be obtained prior to the commencement of participation in the study procedures. Tat is, the researcher cannot start any procedures that are part of the study, no matter how benign or insignifcant they are. For example, researchers cannot distribute surveys, questionnaires, or meet with potential participants about anything related to the actual research. Nor can researchers schedule future meetings to begin discussing the details of participation until consent is obtained. Tere needs to be a wall between getting consent and starting any aspect or phase of the formal research project.</p><p>Another question that must be addressed when it comes to informed consent is, what does it mean to give informed consent? Tere is more to it than simply discussing the purpose and details of a study with a potential subject, and having that person agree to participate. Generally, three criteria must be met: information, capacity, and voluntariness. In terms of providing information to the potential subjects, the researcher is obligated to ensure the following are communicated: (1) the person (potential subject) has the right to refuse to give consent without penalty; (2) the person may withdraw consent at any time without penalty, even if they initially agreed to participate and have started participating in the research; (3) the person knows the exact details of the procedures, the expected benefts, and any potential risks; (4) the person knows the risks and benefts of alternative approaches; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(5)</ref> the limits to confdentiality are explained; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(6)</ref> incentives or participation are discussed; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref> who can be contacted if they have questions; and (8) they are given the opportunity to ask questions. Tus, the researcher must provide full information to the potential subject, explaining the required information that informs the person of basic components of participating, and their rights for withdrawing from that participation.</p><p>Another criterion is that of capacity, which refers to the person who is contemplating giving consent. Tis person must have reached the age of maturity (usually 18 years). Furthermore, this person must be considered competent to make such decisions. What this means is that the researcher must be aware of the age and competency of whom they are asking to participate. Not everyone has the competence to make informed decisions. Some judgment must be made by the researcher as to this qualif cation of the potential subject. If there is reason to believe that this person may not be fully understanding the details of participation as described by the researcher, then the researcher must stop recruiting this person. Finally, the researcher must ensure that the potential subject can freely volunteer without any whif of coercion or duress. Tat is, there cannot be any pressure brought to bear to infuence the recruit from agreeing to participate. T is pressure could be formal or informal. For example, suppose that the director of a clinic asks parents of children served by the clinic for their consent to have their children participate in a research study to be conducted at the clinic. Some parents might feel compelled to give that consent, thinking that if they did not consent, there would be negative repercussions on their child in terms of service delivery (e.g., reducing hours or intensity of service) or quality (e.g., having less-trained staf be scheduled to work with their child). In cases like this, the director must put in place safeguards and procedures that remove, as much as possible, any hint of coercion.</p><p>Another term possibly unfamiliar to behavior analysts is assent. Generally speaking, it refers to the researcher obtaining some type of overt agreement from the potential participant that indicates</p><formula xml:id="formula_87">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>the participant is willing to participate. 4 T is difers from gaining informed consent, which is usually confrmed by signing a consent form. Note that assent means more than an absence of objection to participating; assent requires some sort of overt response indicating willingness. Furthermore, researchers usually focus ef orts for gaining assent from individuals who are not of a legal age or status to provide informed consent. Te clearest example of this would be research focusing on underaged children, or individuals with developmental disabilities. Member of both of these populations are likely to not have the age or the cognitive capacity to give fully informed consent (note the reference to capacity, above ). Tus, researchers are obligated to obtain assent from the participants themselves. Te researcher must approach the potential subject using language that they can understand, and present the proposed study in a form that increases chances of understanding.</p><p>Finally, informed consent also applies to the balance between research and clinical activity. A researcher doing applied research must take care to not detract from the time the individual is receiving services, so that the research can be conducted. Research cannot negatively impact the delivery of clinical services. Finally, if the researcher is planning on disseminating information obtained by the research project in professional venues (e.g., professional journals, professional conferences), that intention must be made clear as part of the process of obtaining consent.</p></div>

Te director claimed that the researcher had no consent to try to publish or present these fndings. On the other hand, the researcher was convinced that the wording of the consent form implied dissemination to professional venues.</p><p>What should happen here? How should this be resolved?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.05">Confdentiality in Research (See 2.03, 2.04, 2.05)</head><p>Behavior analysts prioritize the confdentiality of their research participants except under conditions where it may not be possible. Tey make appropriate eforts to prevent accidental or inadvertent sharing of confdential or identifying information while conducting research and in any dissemination activity related to the research (e.g., disguising or removing confdential or identifying information).</p><p>Te default assumption of this code item is that conf dentiality rules. Researchers have the obligation to make sure that the identity of the research participants remain private. No names, addresses, pictures, or other potentially identifying information can be used by the researcher during or afer the research is completed, such as when presenting the research in a public forum. T e researcher has the responsibility of disguising or deleting any information that could lead to the identifcation of an individual research participant. Tis is demanded both during the research study, and then af er, when the results of the study are disseminated in some fashion.</p><p>Te issue of confdentiality has grown more sophisticated over recent years. In particular, the concern has deepened to focus on more than the obvious information that pertains to identif cation, such as name, picture, and address. Now the behavior analyst must consider any and all possible ways that participants could be identif ed. Tis wider net could include name of school or city, general information about the immediate geographical information, or even particular behavioral or learning traits that are so uncommon that, if described in some public forum, someone could identify a participant. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the researcher to protect the anonymity of the participants. If a participant is identifed publicly, then no matter how extensive the eforts were on the part of the researcher to protect that identity, the researcher will be held responsible.</p></div>

During their oral presentation, the researchers mentioned that the research was conducted in Omaha, Nebraska, at a private agency serving young children with autism, and that a unique feature of that school was that it served an inordinate number of children of families who were stationed at a large military base right outside Omaha. Te researchers went on to explain some of the social defcits exhibited by their participants, including a little girl, aged 5, who consistently kept her eyes closed during the school day to avoid social interactions. During this 2-day conference, the local newspaper sent reporters to cover some of the featured talks, and a review of this particular talk was published in the local Omaha newspaper as a "human interest" story. Two weeks af er the conference, the researcher was contacted by a lawyer representing the parents of one of the children involved in the research. Te lawyer accused the researcher of breaking the confdentiality requirement. It seems that a neighbor of these parents read the newspaper article, including the description of the one participant who kept her eyes closed. Tis neighbor recognized the girl (from seeing her in her local community and living on the same street). Tat neighbor had mentioned to the parents that she had seen the article and asked questions about what it was like to be in that research study.</p><p>What did the researcher do wrong? How could the researcher have better ensured complete conf dentiality? Troughout the ethical code, we see that behavior analysts only conduct work for which they have received training and can be argued to be competent in doing. Te same is true with research activities: a behavior analyst who conducts research must be trained in all aspects of research and must document that they have maintained the skills to conduct research. For those of us who have conducted research, we understand the complexity of planning and doing competent and ethical experimentation, ranging in topics from research design, measurement, reliability, and fdelity. In addition, there are ethical standards pertaining exclusively to research activities, that the researcher must understand and abide by, such as protection of human rights and particular ethical requirements promulgated by the researcher's university IRB or HRC.</p><p>To put this another way, a behavior analyst who assisted a research project-say, for example, performed as a research assistant for one experiment while in graduate school-is likely to not meet this requirement of competence and training. Tis level of experience typically does not expose the research assistant to all aspects of planning and executing a research study, nor does such a position in a research study permit the level of depth of experience regarding the conducting of research. Tus, this particular ethical code item mandates that anyone who is considering conducting research obtain the necessary training and experience to be considered adequately prepared to plan and implement a</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 6 â¢ 289</formula><p>research study. Common examples of sufcient proof of experience and competence could include graduate school experience in supporting research activities, experience in all aspects of planning and conducting research, courses on research design and data analysis, and conducting one's own research (e.g., for a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.06 RESEARCH INEPTNESS</head><p>A behavior analyst fnished her master's degree program and was working in her dream job, that of being a supervisor in a school district, responsible for supporting teachers who work with students with challenging behaviors. Afer several months on the job, she noticed that few teachers were using any sort of classroom-wide behavior management system. Knowing that implementing such a program would be very helpful in managing behavior and increasing motivation, she planned a research study concerning the development and application of such a group system. She started taking data in three diferent classrooms on the frequency of problem behaviors, and developed a protocol for teachers to use to implement class-wide reinforcement and contingency contracts. Due to particularities within each classroom, the behavior analyst varied the behavioral def nitions and had diferent types of data systems in place to collect diferent measurements from the diferent teachers (e.g., frequency counts in one classroom, partial-interval data in a second classroom, and time sampling in the third room). About one month into the data collection, she was discussing her research in the teacher lounge with a colleague who worked at the school. When the BCBA mentioned some of the particulars of the research study, her colleague began questioning her about the extent to which parents were informed of the study and possible</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>risks and benef ts. Te BCBA admitted that she had not gone through a formal informed consent process, since the students were in the school already and the teacher had the opportunity and power to implement programs that they wished to try. Upon further questioning, the BCBA revealed that she didn't bother to present her proposal to the district's HRC. Quite concerned now, the colleague asked whether the BCBA had ever been involved in research activities in her past training. Te BCBA confrmed that she had taken (and passed with an "A") a research methods course, and a course on statistics.</p><p>Is the BCBA behaving ethically? Conficts of interest refer to a perception-or in some cases, the reality-of two or more competing interests on the part of the researcher. For example, a researcher might desire to conduct research, not only because of the search for knowledge on some topic but also because that research will be an important factor when the researcher goes up for tenure or full-time status at her university. Another potential confict of interest includes a researcher having a grant from a particular organization that might beneft from any positive f ndings the research found. For example, a behavior analyst might work for a pharmaceutical company that markets a medication for individuals with ADHD.</p><p>Te job of this behavior analyst could be to conduct research on strategies and tactics to support these individuals with a packaged intervention consisting of medication and behavioral contracting.</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 6 â¢ 291</formula><p>In any research study, the behavior analyst would be obliged to recognize his connection with the pharmaceutical company, because there is a possible (if not real) confict of interest. In particular, the drug company could possibly beneft from any research on strategies for behavioral improvements.</p><p>Most professional journals now require authors of research studies to publicly list potential confict of interests, or to state that they have none, within the body of the publication. Conf icts of interest do not arise simply due to fnancial reasons. T is particular code item requires the behavior analyst to publicly declare any possible factor that could potentially positively impact the behavior analyst when doing the research.</p><p>It is not the case that conficts of interest are necessarily bad or will, for certain, taint the research project or results. Of en there are potential confict of interests. In this particular code item, the behavior analyst is required to identify potential conficts of interest, and then readers and consumers of this research can decide for themselves whether or not those factors would inf uence their perception of the quality of the results and implications/ conclusions gleaned from the research.</p></div>

If this technology were to successfully teach this skill, there would be a huge market for selling this product. Te company hired a BCBA-D, well known in autism treatment, to work on the project and provide expert advice on components of the technology that might involve educational principles <ref type="bibr">(e.g., shaping, fading, prompting, and reinforcement)</ref>. Part of the consulting included conducting research on this new technology to determine if it could do what it was claimed to do. Te BCBA-D contacted several agencies serving young Tis issue involves integrity. Behavior analysts must be truthful about the degree to which they, as well as others, contributed to a research project. Tis truthfulness is displayed by public acknowledgment of the level of contribution of each coauthor (or co-presenter). Te list of authors in a research paper or presentation that involves three or more authors refects the level of contribution. Te person listed f rst is considered to be the main contributor, the person listed second will be considered as having the second-most contribution to the work, and so on. Regardless of whether the contributor was a professor, clinician, or student, the researcher is obligated to assign credit based upon the amount of work each did on the entire project.</p><formula xml:id="formula_93">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.08 PULLING RANK</head><p>A professor at a well-known university was considered to be the primary authority on a behavioral analysis of human behavior in organizations <ref type="bibr">(i.e., OBM)</ref>. Every year he had several doctoral students working under him, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_94">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ Section 6 â¢ 293</formula><p>a high percentage of the doctoral research dissertations run were published in highly respected journals. A grad student just starting her doctoral research was talking with one of her lab mates about the process, and the student informed her that this professor had a rule that if any doctoral student failed to publish their dissertation within 6 months of graduating, then that professor published it himself and put himself as the frst and only author. T is doctoral student, hearing this for the frst time, thought this was highly inappropriate. Is there a problem here? Tere are two issues in this code item. First, behavior analysts produce research procedures and results that they (and their coresearchers, if any) did and they do not use other people's data or procedures. Researchers develop their own research protocols and do not use the procedures published or developed by others, without the consent or acknowledgment of the other researchers. For example, a replication of a previously published study can be a worthy experiment, but the researcher who is replicating the work is required to acknowledge that the replication procedures were developed by the original authors. Te researcher cannot "pass of" procedures as their own when, in fact, they obtained them elsewhere, from someone else. Te same rule applies to data published by a researcher. Tose data must be original to that researcher. Using previously published data from someone else is considered plagiarism and is not allowed.</p><p>Te second issue regards a behavior analyst using their own data previously published. Tat is acceptable, under the conditions</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 294 â¢ Ethics Standards</formula><p>of full disclosure of that fact by that behavior analyst. It is not permitted to present previously published data as if it is new and never presented before. CASE 6.09 A LONG TIME AGO . . . When considering a potential topic for his master's thesis, a behavior analyst stumbled on an article published in 1947 in the Journal of Psychiatric and Psychosocial Studies. Te study involved a researcher who went into a residential psychiatric facility and obtained permission from the director to select one of the patients and to shape the behavior of turning circles randomly throughout the day, using an elaborate system of continuous and intermittent reinforcement. Once this behavior was established, the researcher invited traditional psychoanalysts to observe the patient and to ofer explanations for this behavior, as it appeared to be very strange and coming out of nowhere. Te researcher did not explain the conditioning part of the experiment.</p><p>Te behavior analyst thought this would be an excellent research study and put in place steps to replicate this work. He sought access to a local residential facility and obtained permission to condition the same behavior in one of the residents. Te behavior analyst committed to work with the resident to not only stop this behavior but to teach that person positive and independent life skills as replacement behaviors, once the experiment was concluded. Since the original study was done almost 80 years ago, and was buried in an obscure professional journal, the behavior analyst felt no need to acknowledge the original researcher or the procedures used in that study. When conducting research, there usually exists clear expectations about how to safely store the data and records while conducting the research, and how to deal with all of the records accumulated during the research once the research study is completed. A researcher does, in fact, have all of the identifying information of each participant (name, address, etc.). How does the researcher protect this information from people who are not authorized to see this information? How does the researcher disconnect the identifying information of the participant from the participant's code number or fctitious identity? Tese are the questions that researchers must consider and act to ethically answer. For example, researchers are required to protect the identity of the participants by giving them fctitious names or code numbers. However, research review committees usually have regulations about how to safely store these data and for how long. For example, there is a basic expectation that the researcher will lock away such private information and be the only one with the key or lock combination to look at it. Currently, such information is kept on a computer hard drive, and the researcher is obligated to keep that computer information private, only accessible by those who the research review committee has permitted to see, ofen by using complicated pass codes.</p><p>Tere are also rules for how long the raw data and other records should be kept by the researcher. A common rule is to keep these</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢</formula><p>records for seven years. Note the ethical requirement here: the behavior analyst is obligated to keep the records for the longest possible duration permitted by the controlling regulation. T e behavior analyst, then, must consider exactly how to store and protect this material. Tis is another layer in the complex requirements for behavior analysts conducting research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.10 STORAGE STRUGGLES</head><p>A behavior analyst focused her work on animal training; specifcally, she was interested in improving the behavior of shelter dogs so that there was a higher frequency of adoption. She conducted an elaborate and extremely compelling study, showing that by setting up conditions that would trigger the dogs to play happily with toys in the presence of prospective adopters, there were more adoptions and happier dogs. Her study took 3 months to complete. As per ethical requirements, the behavior analyst kept all of her data private, safely secured, and confdential. Her data were published in a respected animal training journal. Once the study was published (it took about four months to go through the editorial process), the behavior analyst, thinking that publication of her study defned the end of that period of work, deleted the raw data and all of her videos of the training sessions. About two years later, a famous animal trainer in Europe wrote the behavior analyst, expressing admiration of her work in that particular study, her desire to replicate that research, and asked to see some of the raw data. T e behavior analyst wrote back, saying that she had deleted those data and had nothing to share.</p><p>Is there a violation of ethics here? Integrity, mentioned throughout the code, is on display in this particular item. Behavior analysts report full and complete research results. Tey thoroughly and honestly describe the methodology used and the results. Te results must be complete results, not just the "best-looking" data, to allow readers to have a complete understanding of these research f ndings.</p><p>Emphasis is on two points here: honesty and completeness. Behavior analysts do not fake data. One does not make up results, or "massage" numbers in a way that makes the data any dif erent than it really is. In addition, behavior analysts provide all of the data that are collected when conducting an experiment. "Cherrypicking" data that makes the fnal results more compelling is not allowed. All data must be presented in the fnal analysis. However, if a researcher wants to exclude some data from being reported, the researcher is obligated to discuss that in the research description, explain what data were excluded and provide a strong argument for excluding those data. Tis, then, is published as well, and the scientifc community has the opportunity to read what was excluded and why, and make their own decisions about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of such actions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ 298 â¢ Ethics Standards</formula><p>Tis particular code item, similar to many of the preceding ones, relies on the fundamental traits required by all behavior analysts: honesty and integrity. Behavior analysts are truthful and in all that they do, behave in ways that provide transparent, open, and full disclosure and behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.11 DATA GONE</head><p>A behavior analyst was conducting a research study on the efects of behavioral contracts on improving safety in a warehouse that delivered supplies for mobile homes. T is particular business historically had high rates of injuries among the employees-falling of ladders, strained backs from lif ing, and broken bones from occasionally dropping heavy boxes on their feet. Afer receiving proper consent and approval from an IRB, the behavior analyst implemented her study, utilizing contracts among the employees. Te basic contingency was, if the number of injuries per week fell to a particular level, the employees on that shif would earn a monetary reward (e.g., gif cards). Te study had been in place for 2 months, and the data showed that injuries were signif cantly decreased. Over the past 2 weeks, injuries dropped to zero per day. Te behavior analyst decided to have 2 more days of data and then terminate the research. On the last 2 days of data collection, injuries rose by 5% and 7%, respectively. However, since the preceding 14 consecutive days had no injuries, the researcher thought (a) she had proven her point that the contingency worked and (b) the fnal 2 days must have been aberrations, so she removed those two data points from her analysis when she wrote the results.</p><p>Assuming that the contingency was causally related to the decrease in injuries, does it matter if the last two data points were excluded from the data analysis? Why or why not?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESPONSES TO CASES CASE 6.01 CEASE AND DESIST</head><p>Unfortunately, the BCBA failed to gain all of the approvals needed. Te BCBA should have been aware of not only the existence of the agency's HRC but also the requirement that it review his research application. Te BCBA certainly met the required review by his university's IRB, and by doing so, the BCBA was complying with federal and state regulatory requirements. However, it is the researcher's (and in this case, the BCBA's) responsibility to be completely familiar with the agencies to which he must apply for research activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.02 IRB PROTECTION</head><p>Te IRB had legitimate concerns about potential psychological harm to which the participants might be exposed. It correctly reasoned that when conducting the interviews with grown children of divorced families, reliving these experiences might trigger emotional trauma, sadness, anger, bitterness, or other feelings that could be harmful to the interviewees or at least make them extremely uncomfortable. Te IRB didn't outright reject the research proposal but asked the researcher to consider how to minimize such risk. Afer some deliberation, the BCBA proposed that the participants be treated this way: (1) upon informing the potential participant of the details of the study, the researcher would mention the interviews that she wished to conduct; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(2)</ref> the researcher would directly address the issue of potential emotional discomfort that could result during the interviews, since the participants are being asked to relive a potentially unpleasant part of their past; and (3) the researcher arranged for free counseling services for any participant who felt the need to get support that way. Te researcher planned on giving each research participant the contact information for a local mental health counselor and arranged for the BCBA to pay the cost of any counseling sessions for any participant who became upset during the interviews. In this way, the researcher minimized the potential psychological harm and planned for a way to treat it should it occur. Te IRB reviewed the revised research application, found the added strategies as minimizing potential discomfort, and approved the project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.03 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE</head><p>Tere should have been a careful analysis as to what specif c clinical/school activities were being missed by children participating in the research. When planning on conducting research in a clinical setting, the researcher is obligated to maintain minimal negative impact (if any at all) on the participants in the study. T e researcher must be completely transparent about the time requirements that are necessary to adequately participate in research, and the clinical team should be the driving force as to determining what hours of school could be devoted to research activities with minimal impact on the clinical impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.04 INCOMPLETE CONSENT</head><p>Hopefully, the wording of the consent form would have clearly stated (in words) the plan the researcher had to use the results of any study outside of the confnes of where the study was conducted. So, in this case, it should be a simple matter of checking for such wording. However, in this particular consent form, the explicit wording was not there. It was implied that the fndings would be used to further clinical and educational eforts, but exactly how was not mentioned. Te director was acting conservatively to protect the participants and the families.</p><p>How was this resolved? Te researcher was in a tough spot: a lot of hard work went into the study, with great fndings that could be of interest to many other researchers and consumers. T e researcher suggested several strategies to gain such consent, such as writing another consent form explicitly describing the dissemination that he wanted to do, and asking for that consent. Te director turned down this suggestion. In fact, the director eventually said that the manuscript could not be submitted since, in her opinion, explicit informed consent was not given. Te researcher, to his credit, accepted this decision and buried the manuscript and data, to maintain compliance with research ethics of consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.05 IMPERFECT CONFIDENTIALITY</head><p>Te researcher knew about the issue of confdentiality and apparently thought she was meeting this basic requirement by removing personal identifying information. However, there was other information presented in the conference presentation that provided information that led to the identifcation of the girl and parents. Te naming of the city in which the research took place, the reference to a unique aspect of the school (the connection with a military base), and a description of unique behavioral characteristics, when all put together, allowed for the identifcation of the child and, thus, a breach of conf dentiality. Te researcher should have disguised any and all information that could possibly had led to identif cation of any participant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.06 RESEARCH INEPTNESS</head><p>Te BCBA was acting unethically. Not only was she violating basic research protocol in failing to get approval from a research review committee (the school district's HRC, in this case), but she failed to provide full information to parents of potential subjects in order to get informed consent. More fundamentally, when examining the way she defned behaviors (conficting operational def nitions) and the erratic way of collecting data (using diferent measurement systems across the classrooms), there was no confdence that the BCBA had competence in planning or conducting research. By her own admission, she had never been involved in helping run a research study, and has had no other "frsthand" experience conducting one. If critically reviewed, she would have no argument or evidence to support she was, in the words of this code item, demonstrably competent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.07 UNDISCLOSED</head><p>Te BCBA-D violated the ethical code by failing to disclose her connection with the for-proft company. It could be reasonably implied that the behavior analyst has a fnancial stake in this company. If the technology is proven to be successful in establishing joint attention, it could be reasonably assumed that the behavior analyst will benef t f nancially. Tis connection should have been disclosed upon entering into conversation with each agency about the possibility of conducting research at their agencies. It may not have made a dif erence to the agency, and they may have still agreed to allow the research to take place at their location, but the ethical code obligates us to publicly admit any potential confict of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.08 PULLING RANK</head><p>Te behavior of this professor is highly unethical. Doctoral students do most of the research on their doctoral dissertations. T e advising faculty person certainly assists of course, but it is customary that the doctoral student is frst author when the research is f nally published. To have the professor set a time limit for publication is inappropriate, as is his threat to become frst and only author. CASE 6.09 A LONG TIME AGO . . . Te behavior analyst is violating this particular code item of plagiarism. Tis is a clear case of it. Tere is no statute of limitations for acknowledging other's work. Tere is no rule under which a behavior analyst can ethically not acknowledge work that someone else did. Tis BCBA clearly violated this section of the code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.10 STORAGE STRUGGLES</head><p>Te behavior analyst violated the code by not maintain records " for the longest required duration." Typical storage is for seven years. Furthermore, the behavior analyst failed to keep digitized copies of her raw data, as is required by this particular code item.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.11 DATA GONE</head><p>Te code is very clear: all data collected in a research study are to be reported. So, it seems that the behavior analyst is in violation of the code. As this particular code item notes, if data are excluded, there must be an explanation and justifcation as to why. Here again, the behavior analyst seemed to totally disregard the data without taking the opportunity, in her research fndings, to explain that data were removed, what data were exactly excluded, and any defense of that removal.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immediate Response Required</head><p>A BCBA was working with Ami, a 5-year-old girl whose parents were divorced. Te child's father was a wealthy businessman who owned a nationally recognized chain of electronics stores. Because he traveled constantly, he saw his little girl only periodically. Ami was basically mute, but, over a short period of time, the behavior analyst had her saying words and short phrases. Shortly afer Ami began speaking in threeword sentences, the dad, on one of his infrequent visits home, observed a session. Tears rolled down his cheeks, and as he was leaving, he said, "You have done such wonderful things for Ami . . . I know you are just getting started, and money is probably tight. I would like to give you a little token of appreciation. Maybe you and your roommates could use a new 75-inch, fat-screen QLED 8K TV and a year's subscription to Netfix. Does that sound good?" Te behavior analyst had to respond immediately, or a delivery truck would be dropping of a $5,000 high-defnition TV to her apartment. Because she attended an ethics workshop at her state association meeting, she knew behavior analysts should not accept gifs of this size and that the limit was $10! Even though she could not cite the code number, she had the perfect instant response: "T ank you so much for appreciating the work I've done with your daughter. Behavior analysts have an ethics code, and I am not allowed to accept gifs. I am delighted you are so pleased with Ami's progress; just seeing her learn is my biggest reward."</p></div>

I will call you later this afernoon," or "I need to check on this; I'll have an answer for you at Tuesday's meeting." Buying time is a good strategy if the ethical issue seems to be in a gray area and you feel the need to review the ethics code, talk to your supervisor, or consult with a trusted colleague.</p></div>

You don't have classes on the weekends, so I was thinking maybe we could change some of our sessions to Saturday mornings. What do you think?" Tis was a gray area for the young behavior analyst. She needed to recuperate on the weekends, meet with her study group, and prepare for exams. Something about this request just didn't feel right. Te behavior analyst was acquainted with the code and was certain there was not a code item that said, "It is unethical for you to give up your weekends." "I'll have to check with my supervisor and get back to you," was the perfect response.

She says this is against our company policy, which permits us to work only during hours that supervisors are available to handle emergencies. I'm sorry, but we'll have to stick with our regular weekday schedule. If you really want to switch to another day, my supervisor said to just give her a call. Do you need her number?"</p><p>Tere may be times when feedback about an ethical issue needs to be given to a client, parent, stakeholder, another behavior analyst, a nonbehavioral professional, a supervisor, or a supervisee. In each case, the behavior analyst should think about whether delivering the message is enough. Does a supervisor need to be contacted? Do staf members need to be informed about something a client did? Should an agency be notifed about something that has been witnessed?</p></div>

In most cases, clients are children, and they won't be involved with ethical misconduct. However, there are situations where behavior analysts work with high-functioning adult clients, and they can present some ethical challenges.</p><p>Shari was a BCaBA who was assigned to work to a group home for high-functioning male clients. When Dan, one of the clients, started f lirting with her, she put his inappropriate comments on extinction. Then he asked, "Shari, why don't you and I go out on Friday night? You can come and pick me up, and we can go to a movie and out to eat." Clients in the group home had many opportunities for community outings, and this was clearly a request for a " date." Shari knew instantly that dating a client would be a violation of the ethics code. What should she say?</p><p>Here are some things she should not say: "Well, okay, Dan, I guess we could work on your social skills.</p><p>Let me think about it." "I'm busy on Friday night." "Umm, no, Dan, I've got a boyfriend." "Sorry, I'm just not that into you."</p><p>Tese excuses imply that if she was not busy and did not have a boyfriend, Shari would be open to going out with Dan. Accepting the invitation with a plan of training social skills along the way will send a mixed mes-Remember the fundamentals sage to Dan. He will think he's of good communication: just landed a date. Remember don't send mixed messages, the fundamentals of good and don't lie. communication: don't send When Shari was telling us her story, we knew what was coming before she said it. She did a good job giving Dan the message as previously presented, and then he said, "I'm getting my very own place in a few weeks. I won't be a client anymore, and I have a job lined up at Goodwill. Ten can we go out?"</p><p>When clients and family members transition to the status of "no longer a client," it brings up a special ethical dilemma. Is there any likelihood that they will come back into the system? Does your company have a policy about dating former clients (or their parents)? Shari replied with, "Dan, I like you as a friend, but I'm sorry, I'm not interested."

Not taking data, making up stories, not carrying out the program, and crossing the line so their attempts of discipline constitute abuse are just some of the issues reported by behavior analysts.</p><p>Erica M. was the mother of Cooper, a 10-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism. Cooper had very basic expressive language (one-to two-word sentences such as "Want milk" and "Go outside"). He had frequent tantrums that were set of by noises and not getting what he wanted. He also had a self-stimulatory behavior of licking the area under his bottom lip frequently enough to cause calloused skin the full length of his lower lip. Tere were two other children in the busy home. Te BCBA, Melvin, was becoming increasingly frustrated because Cooper's behaviors were getting worse both at school and home, Mrs. M. was not taking the data needed, and the other children revealed that when Cooper was having a tantrum, she gave him a cookie "to get him to calm down."</p><p>Melvin went to the home and met with Mrs. M. He told her how the data were important "so we can help Cooper's behavior get better." It seemed as though the heart-to-heart talk worked like magic, and Mrs. M. had the data sheets ready when Melvin arrived for the next few visits. Before long, Melvin began to notice that something was strange about the data. One day's data was scored for a time period when Melvin knew Cooper was attending an af er-school event. Further, the data showed that Cooper was engaging in no self-stimulatory face licking, yet his face was so infamed there was bleeding at the edges of the calluses. Melvin knew that Mrs. M. was busy making up the data as he pulled into the driveway.</p><p>Here's what Melvin should not do or say: he should not storm into the house and say, "Mrs. M., you have been making up the data. I have been truthful with you, and if you are going to lie to me, I quit. I know when the data are not real."</p><p>Here's what Melvin should say: he found a better way to handle this situation so he could get the necessary data. He talked to Mrs. M. at the beginning of the next session:</p><p>"Hi, Mrs. M. I noticed your new rose bushes. Tey look so nice. My mom always had a rose garden when I was growing up." (Mrs. M. talked about her gardening.) Without asking for the data sheet, Melvin said, "Let's talk about Cooper. So, how has it been going?" (Mrs. M. simply said, "Okay.") "Would you say he was having more tantrums or less or about the same?" (Mrs. M. said that some days were worse than others). Melvin said, "Tis has got to be tough for you. You really have your hands full, and I know a 10-year-old with tantrums can be a real challenge." At this point Mrs. M. began to talk about how she was tired and some days she wasn't sure she could do it all. "You're a great mom," he said. "I know your kids mean the world to you. Can we take a look at the data for the last few days?" He reviewed the data sheet and asked, "With all you've got going, how are you feeling about taking data?" Mrs. M. said, "Okay." Ten Melvin told her, "You know, these data don't make sense. When I look at the boxes you've checked of-see here and here-it looks like Cooper is never having a tantrum or licking his face. But his lips are dried and chapped. Can you talk to me about that?" Mrs. M. said she had noticed Cooper licking his lips when he watched television and worked on the computer at night. Tis was the "screen time" he earned as a reinforcer, and data weren't collected then. T is made sense, and Melvin was able to modify the data collection procedure. Melvin then asked about the data for tantrums. Mrs. M. admitted she was too busy to fll out the forms. She usually did it right before <ref type="bibr">Melvin arrived, and</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DELIVERING THE ETHICS MESSAGE TO AGENCIES, SUPERVISORS, OR ADMINISTRATORS</head><p>Unfortunately, we've had a number of behavior analysts in our ethics workshops describing situations where an administrator has asked the behavior analyst to do something unethical. Asking the behavior analyst to make up data or assessment results or to say that services for a client were needed when they were not (or vice versa) or asking the consultant to work with a friend's child who was not an ofcial client are some of the administratorrelated ethics issues our workshop participants have encountered.</p><p>In some cases, the behavior analyst ends the story with, "And so I no longer work there. I could not sleep at night. I found another job." In other cases, the behavior analyst said, "I didn't know what to do. I love the clients, and I love the actual job. I was afraid if I told anyone or refused to do what was asked, I would get f red. I need my job. I've got two mouths to feed and a mortgage to pay."</p><p>Wendy was the new BCBA at a residential facility. She had the job of her dreams in her favorite city. Afer she had been on the job a few months, the administrator called her into the ofce. "Rumor has it that we are having a review team visit sometime toward the end of the week. I need your help with some behavior programs." She went on to explain that the review team would be checking for assessments and data that were missing for several clients from the last review. She then slid a list across the desk to Wendy. Te administrator was asking Wendy to make up assessment results for four clients who had not yet been seen by any one in behavioral services.</p><p>Here's what Wendy should not say (we always urge restraint in dealing with supervisors; think before you speak; there is of en a lot on the line): Don't ever say,  Here's what should be said to the nonbehavioral professional. Ian has completed his assessment of the child and felt, as a behavior analyst, he needed to address the tantrums and refusal to work. He also wanted to get Cassie moving along with language, and his plan was to talk to the speech therapist about DTT. Ian understood that embarrassing other professionals in front of their colleagues is not a good way to win friends. Ideally, Ian would have seen what was coming and been able to meet with the OT before the meeting. He didn't, so the conversation in the treatment team went like this: Afer Debbie, the OT, gave her spiel, Ian said in a calm, friendly voice, "I agree with Debbie that Cassie has some motor problems. She does fall down, and Debbie is right-it looks like she does not have good trunk control. I agree that Cassie could benef t from some exercise to strengthen her core and improve her balance. But I want to talk about the behavioral issues. When Cassie screams and drops to the foor, she is having a tantrum. I don't know what sets this of yet, but I would like to have tantrums added to the plan as a target behavior."</p><p>Te OT said, "If Cassie doesn't have to sit at the table like she is in college and she gets the exercise and play she needs, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_52">12</ref>.4 shows the analysis of Ian's verbal reply to the nonbehavioral professional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DELIVERING THE MESSAGE TO ANOTHER BEHAVIOR ANALYST</head><p>In some ways, dealing with another behavior analyst who is violating the ethics code is easier than dealing with others, because the behavior analyst should know the code. In other ways, it can be more difcult and awkward to give feedback to a behavioral colleague, especially if that colleague is working for a competing program or consulting f rm.</p><p>Matt was a BCBA whose students (BCaBAs) told him about another behavior analyst (Dr. X) who was billing for clients she never saw. It seems the BA would talk to staf, then would write a program or send a data sheet and would bill for the services. Matt felt very uneasy about this, but he decided he should intervene. He called Dr. X and asked if she had a few minutes to talk. Matt began the conversation like this: "We've known each other for a long time, and we're both professional behavior analysts. I've been hearing about a situation that I wanted to ask you about. Is there any chance you bill for services for a client afer just talking to staf?" Matt's response is shown in the breakdown of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_52">12</ref>.5.</p><p>If Dr. X had said no, this was a misunderstanding; she did this only once when she was sick but immediately got out to see the client when he was well, the conversation could have ended.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dr. X said that business was booming and that she was just trying to cover all the bases. When she knows the staf members are reliable, she will use the information they report to her; she can help more clients and meet the demand and improve her cash fow. "I've got boat payments too, you know," was her parting shot. Matt's response was, "I know you care about people, and you have always been a responsible professional. I don't want to see you get in trouble or your reputation get trashed. Have you looked at the code lately? You could hire BCBAs to work for you; then they would sign the assessments and be responsible. My reading of the code is that you can't sign an assessment for a client based on what someone else has told you. I just wanted to let you know I'm concerned as a fellow professional." Knowing the ethics code backward and forward does not guarantee that behavior analysts will always be effective in helping others understand the code.</p><p>indicate why the code is important for those who strive to deliver ef ective treatment.</p><p>T e frst part of being efective is recognizing when something that is not quite right. Te second part is knowing what to say and how to say it when witnessing an ethical problem. T is can be difcult, especially for new, younger BCBAs who may have to bring the ethics message to someone who is older and has a lot more experience. All BCBAs should know and should follow the ethics code, but it is easy to slip into bad habits. Being ethical every day is hard work, and people, even good people, will sometimes respond to increased response cost with an unethical, knee-jerk reaction. If no one says anything and nothing bad happens, the behavior is likely to occur again. Supervisors can become so overwhelmed with responsibilities that they don't always remember the code. Parents are ofen so consumed with trying everything and anything that might work for their child they don't have to the time to ask whether there is research to back up a claim. Being ethical is a colossal responsibility. It is hard work, but if being ethical were easy, everyone would be ethical. Behavior analysts should be strong, always stay on the right side of ethics, and deliver If being ethical were easy, the ethics message whenever everyone would be ethical.</p><p>possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using a Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures for Behavior Analysts</head><p>W hen it comes to ethics, prevention is a far better strategy than having to solve the awkward or difcult problems that arise because someone didn't know the diference between right and wrong, acceptable and unacceptable. Ethical challenges confront the BCBA almost on a daily basis. Most are not a full-blown crisis but rather are more like the daily meteor showers that our Earth experiences from outer space. Tiny pings on the radar of decisionmaking can irritate, confuse, and confound the behavior analyst who is trying to do the right thing. Tese small challenges can sneak up on you just when you least expect them. Tey are camoufaged in normal conversations in the form of requests for small favors or oferings of juicy gossip. Wouldn't it be great if everyone would just follow the rules? Or, in our terms, why can't we bring some stimulus control to this aggravating situation? Well, there is good news. It is possible to put up something similar Tiny pings on the radar of to a video gamer's def ector decision-making can irritate, shield.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP, LIMITATIONS AND RISKS What I Do</head><p>Behavior analysis is a unique method of treatment based on two ideas: (1) that most important human behavior is learned over time and that, (2) most behavior is currently maintained by consequences in the environment. My job as a behavior analyst is to work with behavior you would like to see changed.</p><p>With your input, I can help you discover what is maintaining a behavior, discover more appropriate replacement behaviors, and then set up a plan to teach those skills. I can also develop a plan to help the client acquire a new behavior or improve their skill level. Some of the time I will be treating you directly and at other times I may be training stakeholders as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How I Work</head><p>As a behavior analyst I do not make judgments about a person's behavior. I try to understand their conduct as an adaptive response (a way of coping) and suggest ways of adjusting and modifying behaviors to reduce pain and sufering and increase personal happiness and ef ectiveness. You will be consulted at each step in the process. I will ask you about your goals, I will explain my assessment and the results of my assessment in plain English. I will describe my plan for intervention or treatment and ask for your approval of that plan. If at any point you want to terminate our relationship, I will cooperate fully.</p><p>Please know that it is impossible to guarantee any specifc results regarding your goals. However, together we will work to achieve the best possible results. If I believe that my consultation has become nonproductive, I will discuss terminating it and/or providing referral information as needed.</p><p>Behavior analysts are mandated reporters, if we see anything that appears to be abuse or neglect, we are required to report this directly to the Abuse Hotline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES</head><p>I can only work with clients who fully inform me of any and all of their concerns. I will need your full cooperation as I try to understand the various behaviors that are problematic for you. I will be asking a lot of questions and making a few suggestions and I need your total honesty with me at all times. I will be showing you data as part of my ongoing evaluation of treatment and expect that you will attend to the data and give me your true appraisal of conditions.</p><p>One of the most unique aspects of behavior analysis as a form of treatment is that decisions are made based on objective data that are collected on a regular basis. I will need to take Baseline data to f rst determine the nature and extent of the behavior problem that we are dealing with; then I will devise an intervention or treatment with your consent and continue to take data to determine if it is ef ective. I will show you this data and will make changes in treatment based on this data.</p><p>I expect that you will treat me and my staf including my RBTs with dignity and respect. To do otherwise including verbal threats, accusations, cursing, making defamatory, sexually or racially charged comments may result in immediate discontinuation of services.</p><p>Under my code of ethical conduct, I am not allowed to work with you in any other capacity except as your behavior therapist or consultant. If I or one of my RBTs is working in your home with your child, it is not appropriate for you to leave the premises at any time, you will need to be present to observe the treatment and to learn to apply it when we are not present.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">AREAS OF EXPERTISE/SCOPE OF COMPETENCE</head><p>Te declaration starts by informing your client-or better yet your prospective client-about who you are and your credentials.</p><p>Te client should know some basic academic information about you, where you got your degree, the feld in which you earned the degree, and the specifc degree (e.g., BA, MA, PhD). Some consultants might be uncomfortable about providing this information, particularly if the degree is in experimental psychology or pastoral counseling or was earned through a series of online courses from an unaccredited college. In any event, clients have a right to know about the education and training of their consultants. T ey should also know how many years you have been practicing and, most importantly, what you consider your specialty. Disclosing your specialty area is very important, because clients have a right to know up front if you are practicing within the boundaries of your training and expertise. In a recent case, for example, a BCBA with two years' experience in autism and developmental disabilities was asked by a parent to help with a suicidal and possibly homicidal teen on the autism spectrum. When she reminded the frantic mom that this was not her area of expertise, she was scolded for not being sensitive to the mother's needs: "I'm desperate here, can't you see that? I'm afraid he's going to hurt himself or someone else, and I don't know who else to turn to. You've got to help me. " When the BCBA told the Clients have a right to mother that a referral to a suicide know up front if you counselor was needed, the mother are practicing within replied, "I don't want anyone else the boundaries of your to know about this; I've got enough training and expertise.</p><p>trouble as it is. Please don't tell anyone. Just tell me what to do. "</p><p>Because behavior analysts have an obligation to keep current with new developments, this section of your declaration should be updated every year. If you lose clients because they do not feel comfortable with your expertise, consider this a blessing in disguise. Surely you do not want to fnd yourself partway down the therapy road, have something go terribly wrong, and then have it revealed that you were not qualifed to take the case.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What I Do</head><p>Tis section begins the dialogue in which you explain the basis for behavior analysis services. Tis can be a challenge to explain in plain English, or Spanish, or Hmong, but it is here that you express your understanding of human behavior. In the sample Declaration ("What I Do"), we say that behavior analysis is "a unique method of treatment based on two ideas: (1) that most important human behavior is learned over time and that (2) most behavior is currently maintained by consequences in the environment. " It is critical to put this philosophy on the table to make sure your client understands your position. We also stress the notion that, as behavior analysts, we work with input from clients and that we develop a plan to acquire new behaviors. It is also important to let clients know that you work with signifcant others, so family members will play a key role in the therapy if this is part of the treatment design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How I Work</head><p>It is important to spell out for clients that we do not make judgments about behavior and that it is part of our belief system that "psychological" pain and suffering come from behaviors that do not adapt well to the current environment. We do consult with parents, teachers, and other individuals significant in the life of our client (with permission). This should be clearly spelled out at the initial meeting where the declaration is presented. This concept is not likely to be something parents or family members might understand otherwise. Most people would expect you to come in and work only with the individual child or adult, much like the individual session a psychiatrist would have.</p><p>It is a strong selling point of behavior analysis that we are not interested in changing only behavior per se, but rather we work toward achieving important life goals for the client. We refer to this as "increasing personal Finally, in the last part of this section, we urge BCBAs to make clear to clients that we are not in the "cure" business, and that we do not guarantee results. If clients don't understand from the beginning that results aren't guaranteed, they will surely become disenchanted when expected outcomes are not forthcoming.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES</head><p>Up to this point, the declaration has been a clarifcation of your qualifcations and how you operate. In this section of the declaration, you'll cover the possibly touchy subject of what your expectations are for clients. We need and expect their full cooperation and their total honesty in dealing with us. In a recent case, it was discovered that the mother-in-law did not approve of applied behavior analysis services for the child. In most circumstances this might not matter, but in this matriarchal family, it did. Her position was that the tantrums, aggression, and noncompliance of the 7-year-old client were the result of poor discipline, and she blamed her son for not using his belt ofen enough. "He's just spoiled; he does not need psychologists poking around in his life. My son is to blame for treating a 7-year-old like a baby." T e mother-in-law managed to cause so much trouble that the case was terminated, following standard protocols and necessary referrals.</p><p>If you can accomplish buy-in to the behavior analysis approach, you will probably be asking parents or family members to take data. Te success of the treatment depends on those who take the data being absolutely honest about it. Tere may be considerable pressure to make the behavior analyst happy by presenting data that show the problem is solved. Fake data are a behavior analyst's worst nightmare. Essentially what the mediators/stakeholders (whether parents, teachers, or night shif supervisors) are saying is that they do not value data collection; it means nothing to them. Te importance of accurate data should be brought up not only prior to the onset of services but also occasionally during the entire treatment process.</p><p>Behavior analysts need to know more about the client ing. Of course, it is critical to know about drugs and medications because they could afect the client's behavior. A particular concern these days is the contamination of our evidence-based methodology with popular but confounding and potentially dangerous treatments, or "cures," as they are sometimes called. It is best to fnd out when services begin if there are any procedures or substances in use such as strange or exotic vitamins, diets, or even "natural" products such as bee pollen as treatments. Data from the National Science Foundation biennial report <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Shermer, 2002)</ref> shows what we're up against when it comes to dealing with non-scientists. Te Shermer report (2002, p. 1) states that "30 percent of adult Americans believe that UFOs are space vehicles from other civilizations, 60 percent believe in ESP, 40 percent think astrology is scientifc, 70 percent accept magnetic therapy as scientifc, and 92 percent of college grads accept alternative medicine." In a broader sense, there is a more fundamental problem, which is that "70 percent of Americans still do not understand the scientifc process, defned in the study as comprehending probability, the experimental method and hypothesis testing" <ref type="bibr">(Shermer, 2002, p. 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A total of 40% of adult</head><p>Finally, to prevent annoying requests for last-minute schedule changes, it is a good idea to include your personal (or your company's ofcial) policy on appointments. Note that we indicate a 24-hour notifcation policy, but your company may prefer some other time frame. If your policy is that missed weekday appointments cannot be moved to weekend days, this should be stated in the declaration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ETHICS CODE FOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS</head><p>Behavior analysts should be proud of their strict code of ethics and should make sure that all clients are aware of these standards. We recommend making a copy of the code and presenting it to new clients, possibly with key sections highlighted. As a behavior analyst, you should also inform clients that if they have any questions about your conduct, they may contact the BACB directly at the address listed on the Declaration.</p><p>One very important element we always recommend including in the Declaration is a clear statement on gifs and invitations to dinners, parties, and celebrations. Tese small tokens of appreciation can start the unwary behavior analyst down the slippery slope to compromise of professional judgment and create dual relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONFIDENTIALITY</head><p>Breaches of confdentiality are among the most frequently occurring problems for BCBAs. Consultants are ofen asked to give out information that is confdential. Professionals who should know better also sometimes reveal confdential information. We recommend telling clients directly that you will keep any information given to you as strictly confdential and that you cannot give out information about any other clients. It is also wise to inform clients of the limits to conf dentiality; that is, if you feel that the individual is a danger to himself or herself or others, you can share this information <ref type="bibr">(Koocher &amp; Keith-Spiegel, 1998, p. 121)</ref>.</p><p>Be sure to check your local laws regarding reporting of abuse or neglect, and include this information in your declaration. At our ethics workshops, we've had at least two cases reported to us in the past year where a BCBA saw abuse or evidence of abuse, reported it, and then was quickly fred by the family. Abuse notif cation is supposed to be confdential, but ofen there are leaks or the family makes a good guess about who reported the incident. Avoiding possible loss of revenue from a dropped case is no reason to look the other way when it comes to abuse and neglect; to do so is not only unethical but is also a violation of the law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">APPOINTMENTS, FEES, AND EMERGENCIES</head><p>In this fnal section of the declaration, you'll need to spell out the details of how appointments are made, your fees and how billing is handled (if you work for an agency the business department will handle this), and the method for dealing with emergencies. At a recent conference on ethics for itinerant teachers who work in the homes of DD clients, there was considerable discussion as to whether clients should be given the cell phone numbers of their therapists. Most of the teachers who gave out their cell numbers regretted the decision. However, afer giving some thought about the implications in your particular situation, you should specify the rule for phone calls from your clients; you can't just be on call 24/7. As a fnal item in this section, billing is a topic that most behavior analysts would not discuss with clients; this is handled by the business ofce. At a minimum, you must describe how this is done and who should be contacted if there are complications. Other than turning in their hours, under normal circumstances, BCBAs are not involved directly in billing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WARMïºUP</head><p>Te following is a question that came to the ABA Ethics Hotline from a BCBA who clearly made a mistake when she accepted a job working at this company.</p><p>"One of my close friends and coworkers reached out to the hotline a month or so ago concerning ethical violations within a company for which she and I worked. I am no longer employed, and my friend has given her notice to resign. I've had quite a few major legal and ethical issues from this, and I don't know where to go from here. I understand this is an Ethics Hotline, but perhaps you could provide some feedback.</p><p>" Te company we worked for has grown very quickly and has put proft over any and all client needs. We have been denied adequate supervision, adequate training for RBTs, and have been subjected to a very hostile work environment, among many other ethical violations.</p><p>" Tree months ago, I discovered that our 'quality assurance' BCBA was altering my signed treatment plans to decrease my recommended treatment hours (for supervision and parent training) and deleting my clinical recommendation paragraphs. When I brought this major illegal behavior to the BCBAs attention, it was brushed of by her and the entire company. I was told I had to agree to the new plans and there was no room to negotiate. Afer some investigation, I later discovered that the BCBA had changed nearly ALL of my treatment plans afer I had signed them. One of the treatment plans that my coworker took over was signif cantly dif erent from my original plan. One code (for billing) was dropped to 10% from 20% and the parent training code was reduced as well. My signature was removed from the document or was altered in some way, but the family and clinicians knew I wrote and billed for the plan. When I brought up the ethical issues of denying us ability to use our clinically recommended hours and mentioned legal concerns, I was told I was being unethical for refusing to sign the documents.</p><p>Last month I was terminated for reasons that I can prove are false. I suspect and can prove I was terminated for whistleblowing (a threat of fling a Notice with the BACB if changes weren't made) along with regular indications of what appeared to me to be illegal activity. I believe that altering medical documents is a felony. I am mostly concerned about the illegal and unethical conduct that is afecting the clients. Parents have begun raising concerns too.</p><p>I spoke to another employee who was terminated af er she discovered illegally altered behavior intervention plans and other medical fles that were tampered with on DocuSign afer the BCBA signed them. When this previous employee confronted the VP of operations (who is an investor) she was told, 'Be nicer to corporate.' Tis employee was then demoted, her access to all company fles was stripped, and she was terminated weeks later for 'Using too many big words. "Tis company is owned by an investment frm and the head of operations is the main investor and is an MBA, not a BCBA. I didn't realize this at the time I was hired ." (See 6-month follow-up at the end of this chapter.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DO YOUR HOMEWORK</head><p>Before you agree to any interviews with ABA companies, we strongly advise you to fnd out as much as you can about the company's history and current operation. Internet searches ofen yield information that you won't f nd on their website or in the interview. T ere are sites where employees leave comments related to ABA companies, and you might fnd these useful. You can also determine if the agency/company/organization is accredited, which could be important. Accreditation usually tells you something about the work environment and if the company is required to meet high standards. One red fag is if the company has been bought out by private equity partners. If not, and it is in the hands of behavior analysts who come under the code of ethics, that is usually a good sign. Many company websites also give some background on their behavior analysis staf, so check on this to learn more about who your potential future colleagues. Tere are two more things to watch out for. First, if you are considering a position at an agency where you will be the only behavior analyst, be sure to ask questions about how behavior program decisions are made. Second, if you are applying to work for a school district, be sure to take a copy of the code of ethics with you to the interview. Be prepared to ask questions about procedures for consent for behavior assessments and programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOW TO PRESENT YOURSELF</head><p>Armed with as much information as you can gather about each company where you are applying, make sure that when you arrive at the interview that you give a professional appearance. Business casual is the standard dress code, and the ideal demeanor is "professional but not uptight. " You need to be relaxed, alert, and ready to have a good conversation. You should pitch yourself according to the ethics code. Be honest about your qualifcations, don't exaggerate your skill set, and be prepared to discuss your scope of competence. You will want to read and think about Code 1.10 regarding any personal biases you might have. Be sensitive to questions along that line when it comes to the types of clients you might be working with and colleagues from diferent backgrounds. Also, depending on whether this is a frst, second, or third interview with a company, you may be meeting with the corporate recruiter, the clinical director or the CEO. You will need to pick and choose which questions are appropriate from those listed below. BCBA? Good answer: We match the clients to the expertise of the BCBA; we don't want to go beyond the boundaries of competence for anyone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER ASKING IN YOUR INTERVIEW</head><p>we encourage our behavior analysts to present when they have good material. We also bring in one of our expert consultants each year for a half-day dedicated workshop, and the rest of the day is individual consultation with staf . Dubious: I think you are required to get CEUs each year, right? So, you can request unpaid time of to go to a conference. We pay mileage, but the BCBAs pay the rest.</p><p>Poor answer: I've seen people fall asleep at these conferences and still get CEU credit, so we urge our BCBAs to get their CEUs online. Also, everyone knows there is a lot of partying that goes on at these conferences, and we aren't paying for that. Dubious: Well, since we work in a clinic, it's easy to observe all of the BCBAs and their supervision. We all just observe each other and make sure everyone is following the guidelines for supervision.</p><p>Poor Answer: You've passed the exam already and had two years of master's level education. You shouldn't need supervision unless you are doing something wrong. 9. How do your supervisors meet Code 4.08 and 4.10 for evaluating their supervision of trainees and RBTs and evaluating their supervision practices? Good answer: We bought a dashboard sofware platform just for this purpose. Te supervisors enter their data weekly on their RBTs and supervisees as well as client progress.</p><p>Te dashboard automatically calculates the data and gives real-time graphics showing exactly where everyone is relative to their goals. Anyone in the red zone immediately is fagged, and the supervisor meets with them to review the data and then conducts in-person observations and begins the shaping process using BST. Most supervisees are in the green zone the majority of the time; occasionally one will slip into the yellow zone, and they will receive an automatic text message that says, "Please meet with me at your earliest convenience. " Dubious: Te clinical director sent out a memo to all the BCBA supervisors and reminded them about those two code items. I think they also had a meeting to discuss how to meet that standard. Poor answer: Originally, the company was started by three BCBAs, but just recently a private equity company bought them out and we are going through some changes. 19. How involved in day-to-day operations are the owners (directors, managers) of the company? Good answer: We have a board of directors, but they are defnitely hands-of in terms of the day-to-day running of the company. Tey set policy, but our CEO is our manager. Dubious: Well, to be honest, some of the board members are parents, and they do come around asking questions. T ey sort of intimidate our staf, and some want special treatment for their child.</p><p>Poor answer: I guess a board member has a right to get involved in day-to-day operations, such as how we provide treatment and so on. Afer all, they founded the company and want it to be run according to their vision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dubious:</head><p>We certainly have a policy on that, but I'm not sure it is fully enforced to be honest.  I f you are a student, at this point in your professional develop- ment thoughts about ethical problems in your chosen career probably seem far, far away and much more theoretical than practical. However, in the not-too-distant future, perhaps just a few months from now, you will be starting your frst job. You will almost immediately begin to confront very real ethical dilemmas, some of which could afect the rest of your professional life. T e purpose of this chapter is to outline some common issues that are likely to be encountered and to provide you with practical tips for handling these issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CHOOSING A SETTING OR COMPANY</head><p>T e frst big decision will involve choosing your f rst professional position. New consultants tend to think that the primary considerations for deciding on a job involve salary, location, potential for advancement, and matching professional interests and behavioral skills. All of these are clearly important factors, but one additional choice involves consideration of the ethics and values of the company or organization itself. Currently, behavior analysts are a hot commodity in many cities across the country. For some agencies, hiring a BCBA is essential for funding, insurance reimbursement, or to get relief from a federal lawsuit. In such cases, the agency may of er very high starting salaries and extensive beneft packages just to get you on board. Be wary and ask a lot of questions about these positions. Remember the old saying, "When something appears too good to be true, it is probably too good to be true" (see Chapter 14 for questions to ask). Tere is some chance that you will encounter situations where you are asked to sign of on programs that you have not written, approve procedures with which you are not familiar, or to support agency strategies that are more public relations smoke and mirrors than behavioral methodology. It is entirely appropriate to ask about the history of the agency, company, or organization. Who founded it? What is the primary mission of the company? What is their vision going forward? What are the values of the organization? And how does behavior analysis ft into this framework? You will also want to consider if there any problematic issues associated with the organization. For example, is this company currently under investigation by state or federal ofcials? Are there any "citations" from a recent state or federal survey? Other questions to ask include the following: How many other behavior analysts are currently employed there? What is the company's turnover rate for behavior analysts? What is the funding stream? Who are the clients? Who will you be primarily supervising? Will your supervisees be RBTs and BCaBAs or trainees wanting to get their supervision hours? What other responsibilities will you have such as chairing committees? Will you be expected to attract and hire additional BCBAs?</p><p>You should be able to discern from the answers and the way the interviewer handles your questions whether there might be some ethical problems with the way that the company operates. A recent case, for example, involved a small private school for children with autism that was started by parents. Te school, initially headed by a BCBA-D, came under scrutiny by some parents and former employees when it was learned that the BCBA-D quit abruptly and was not replaced by another equally qualif ed professional. Furthermore, two of the BCaBAs also lef the organization and were not replaced. Te school originally attracted parents with its claim of a behavioral approach led by a certif ed person. Despite the recent vacancies in behavioral positions, it still advertised itself as "behaviorally based" and still charged top dollar. Clearly, since this organization had gone more than 2 years without any behavior analysts, this could be a very challenging situation for a new hire. To have any chance of success as a behavior analysts in this school, a keen awareness of ethical problems and an ability to resolve them would be required. In another case, a rehabilitation facility that was part of a national chain billed itself as behavioral but hired a non-behavioral administrator. T is is quite common, but in this case the individual was subtly antibehavioral in her manner in dealing with the BCBAs and in her mode of operation. BCBAs were told that functional assessments did not need to be done on every client because the problem was quite obvious in most cases. Te administrator also said that data did not need to be taken-it took up too much time-and that she "trusted her staf 's impressions" of client progress. Sadly, in this case, the BCBA did not ask enough questions in Your supervisor sets the tone the initial interview, she for your work: "Just get it did not actually meet the done; I don't care how," is far administrator who held these views, and she was different from "Be thorough; </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WORKING WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR</head><p>In your job interview with the company or organization, it is a good idea to ask to meet your supervisor. While is rarely of ered, an ethical agency will comply if you make the request. Usually, you will meet with the administrator, go on a brief tour, perhaps have lunch with some of the professional staf members, and then sit down with someone from the personnel of ce to negotiate your salary and benefts. However, meeting with the actual person by whom you will be supervised is essential if you want to start your frst job on a strong ethical foundation. Tere are many things you can learn from potential new supervisors, including their style: Are they a reinforcing kind of person or somewhat negative or aloof? Are they interested in working with you, or do they want you do to their work? Is there any chance they are somewhat jealous of you because you might have a degree from a prestigious graduate school, and you might be somewhat threatening? You should feel certain that you will not be asked to do anything unethical. T is translates into (1) you will be able to do your work responsibly; (2) you will have the time and resources to do a great, ethical job; and (3) your supervisor, most likely the clinical director, will be there to guide you through troubled waters should the occasion arise. Your supervisor sets the tone for your work: "Just get it done; I don't care how," is far diferent from "Be thorough; get it right; we want what is best for the clients." So, in meeting with new supervisors, you might ask about their philosophy of management and about the most difcult ethical issue they have encountered in the last year and how they handled it. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEARN JOB EXPECTATIONS UP FRONT</head><p>If you have followed our suggestions up to this point, you will be happy and excited about your new position as a professional behavior analyst, making a good living, and helping people. Before you get too carried away, it would be a good idea to clarify exactly what you are supposed to do on a day-to-day basis. In your f rst 3 months on any job, you have a grace period where you can ask questions without appearing to be slow to catch on. If you are going to be analyzing behavior, doing functional assessments, writing programs, and training staf, you should be well prepared from your graduate work. However, each agency and organization has its own method for doing each of these tasks. Your f rst assignment is to fnd out how administrators want it done. So, ask for copies of "exemplary" intake interviews, case workups, functional assessments, and behavioral programs. You can avoid embarrassing and potentially ethically challenging situations if you know how your new agency routinely handles complaints from consumers, inquiries from review committees, and issues with state agencies. You can make sure that your ethical standards match the other professionals if you review minutes of IEP or case-management team meetings and take a look at behavior programs written by previous behavior analysts. You might also want to know in advance if you are expected to chair the weekly case review meetings or to simply attend and whether, in these meetings, there is open discussion of ethical issues. One of the most important job-related ethical issues involves whether you will be working within your scope of competence or whether you will be asked to take on cases or tasks for which you are not fully qualif ed.</p><p>One freshly graduated BCBA joined some others in a mental health facility, where she was assigned to the Developmental Disabilities Defendant Program for which she was highly qualif ed. Afer a few weeks, she was asked to do some IQ testing on some mental health patients. Tis proposed assignment was job on every case that you are assigned. If you put your heart and soul into your work, watch out for conficts of interest, and "do no harm, " you will be fne. But if you take on too many cases, then it is almost certain that clients or stakeholders will start complaining, your supervisor will notice that your reports are incomplete, or the peer review committee will begin making negative comments about your programs. In behavior analysis, doing more is not always associated with doing better. Quality counts. T is is especially the case because you are afecting the life of a person with your work. You owe it to your clients as well as yourself to closely follow Code 4.03, Supervisory Volume, and take only the number of cases that you can do well and hand the rest back to the clinical director. You will probably have to work on your autoclitics in the process: "I'm sorry, Ms. Rodriguez, but I have to give this case back to you. I would love to work with a client like that, but I am at my maximum right now. " Be sure to document this interaction by taking contemporaneous notes, which are fled away for easy reference.</p><p>This same philosophy holds for taking on cases for which you have no expertise (see Code 3.03 Accepting Clients). In your training, you may not have worked at all with clients who are sex offenders, who have a comorbid diagnosis of mental illness, or who are profoundly physically disabled. You are not doing yourself or the client any favors by taking these cases. You will no doubt be under a lot of pressure to do so from parents, teachers, or program administrators, but if you realize the harm that could be done by taking a case and then handling it badly, you will think twice about this decision. The easiest and most ethical stance to take is to always work within your range of competence. If you want to broaden your scope of competence (see Code 1.05), the proper approach is to find another professional to serve as your mentor, someone who can give you proper training and supervision. You may also want to consider taking additional graduate coursework in a specialty area in addition to doing a practicum with supervision from an expert in that area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USING DATA FOR DECISIONïºMAKING</head><p>One of the distinguishing characteristics of the profession of behavior analysis is the reliance on data collection and data analysis. Te FABA has a motto: "Got data?" Tis logo is available on T-shirts, cofee mugs, and key chains as a spinof on the California "Got milk?" campaign of a few years ago. If there is anything that distinguishes us from other human services professionals, it is that we have a strong ethic in favor of objective data (not anecdotal, not self-report, not survey, not questionnaire) on individual behavior and the use of these data to evaluate the efects of treatments we devise and implement (see Codes 2.17 and 4.08). It is unethical to continue a treatment without taking additional data to see if it was efective. Most behavior analysts agree to this, and, although it is procedural, it is written into our code of ethics (Code 2.18). So, as long as you are taking data and using them to evaluate a procedure, you are ethically in the clear, right? Well, not exactly. It is actually a little more complicated than this. First of all, as you know, there are data, and then there are data. Te latter is reliable, meaning interobserver agreement (IOA) checks that are carried out under specif ed conditions with a second, independent observer and reach a certain standard) and socially validated (meaning that standards of social validity have been met, again under specif ed conditions). It can be argued that a practicing behavior analyst not only has to take data to be ethical but that the data have to meet an IOA standard and be valid. Afer all, there is a lot riding on the data including treatment decisions, medication decisions, and retain, transfer, or discharge decisions. As an ethical behavior analyst, you would not want to use data that were tainted by observer bias or that had an IOA of, for example, 50%. Furthermore, you wouldn't want to make treatment decisions if you thought the data had no social validity. 1 So, what do you do as an ethical behavior analyst? You carry a burden to not only be data based in your decision-making but also to assure the client, stakeholders, and your peers that you have quality data. Remember that quality data is not self-report, it is not anecdotal, and it is not a questionnaire.</p><p>Tere is one fnal issue about the use of data in decisionmaking. Tis has to do with whether your treatment was in fact responsible for any behavior change. Again, to be ethical, it would appear that it is your responsibility to know in a functional sense that it was your treatment that worked and not some outside or coincidental variable. Tis suggests that as a practical, ethical matter, you should be looking for ways of demonstrating experimental control either with a multi-element or multiple baseline across behaviors or settings design. If you put in a treatment and the behavior changes, you cannot in all honesty say it was your intervention, because you don't really know this for sure. Right about the time you instituted your treatment plan, the physician could have made a medication change, or the client may have developed an illness or gotten some bad news, or perhaps someone else put in an intervention about the same time without your knowledge (e.g., the dietician cut back the person's calories, the client's roommate kept him up most of the night). In summary, as an ethical behavior analyst, you are obligated to be data based in your decision-making and to develop a high-quality data collection system that allows you to address issues of reliability, validity, and demonstrations of experimental control. You will f nd that professionals in many areas don't take all of these issues into consideration, and you should be proud to be part of a profession that takes data so seriously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRAINING AND SUPERVISING OTHERS</head><p>As a behavior analyst, you are probably already aware that others do much of the actual treatment. Tese "others" are usually paraprofessionals who are trained by you. Your job as the behavior analyst is to take the referral, qualify the client to make sure they match your expertise and resources, and make sure this falls into the behavioral problem area that your agency/company serves (as opposed to being a nursing problem or education issue, for example), and then perform an appropriate functional assessment to determine likely causes of the behavior. Once this is determined, you will develop a behavior program based on evidence-based, published interventions and then train someone to carry out the interventions. Te people you train to carry out interventions might be parents or other caregivers or stakeholders. Te ethical burden here is that you must not only do the functional assessment according to accepted protocols, but you also have to efectively train the parents, teachers, residential staf, aides, and others. You are ultimately responsible for the program's ef ectiveness. Tis means that the program is carried out to your specifcations. We know from the research literature that some methods of training work and that some do not. T e most reliable form of training is not to simply give the parent a written program and then ask, "Are there any questions?" It is also not acceptable to explain the program and then leave a written copy. It is far more efective, and ethical, if you demonstrate the procedure, then have the parents practice the procedure. Next, you will provide feedback, have them try again, and so on until they execute the procedure according to plan. Tis is how BST should work. Parents should be given a written copy of the procedures, and for complex procedures, a videotape might be helpful. Te next step is for you to make a spot check a few days later to observe the parents to ensure they are being consistent in the application of the procedures. If not, you will need to do some correction, additional role play, additional feedback, and then another visit a few days later. Tis is efective, ethical training. Anything less is unethical.</p><p>Probably within 6 months of taking your frst job, you will be supervising others. In some positions, your role as a supervisor might start immediately. As a behavior analyst, there is a high standard to meet in terms of the quality of your supervision. Because there is such an extensive literature on ways of changing behavior in the workplace (in fact, there is a whole subspecialty called performance management; see <ref type="bibr">Daniels and Bailey, 2014, for details)</ref>, you now have an ethical obligation to be an ef ective supervisor. Becoming an efective supervisor is not dif cult for a person steeped in basic behavior analysis procedures.</p><p>First, make sure you use the most efective antecedents. Don't lecture; demonstrate. Afer the demonstration, ask your supervisees to show you what they've learned. Ten give immediate positive feedback. If you are training someone on how to use written materials (e.g., how to prepare a behavior program), show your trainee a sample of the best program that you can fnd. If necessary, break the task into smaller "bites" of material, and consider using backward chaining if necessary. Practice giving positive reinforcement for work you see and receive every day, many times a day. You will soon discover that your supervisees and trainees seek you out for advice and assistance. Tey will want to show you their work and get your approval. If you are working in a large organization, you could easily become the most reinforcing person without even trying hard.</p><p>Te time will come when you do have to give negative feedback or show disapproval. If you've worked hard to give out contingent reinforcers, the person who receives this punisher will initially be somewhat shocked. He or she might have gotten the initial impression that you were just a "goody two-shoes. " Remember, the purpose of this correction is to change behavior, not punish the person, so you will also want to keep reinforcing the appropriate behavior. And don't forget your autoclitics <ref type="bibr">(Skinner, 1957, chap. 12)</ref>. Tese comments that sofen the blow mean so much when you need to give someone negative feedback. "You know that I value what you do and that your work here has been excellent. I just want to point out something that is not quite right in this behavior program. " One of the best books that can be used as a basic primer for business and professional skills is Dale <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Carnegie's (1981 )</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIME KEEPING FOR BILLING</head><p>An essential part of professional ethics is accountability. One of the most important aspects of accountability is that you keep track of how you spend your time. Time is your primary commodity. For your frst position, you may fnd that you are working on a "billable-hour" model of compensation. In this system, the agency or consulting frm you are working for has contracted for your services at a certain rate per hour, and every documented hour that you work can be billed. You then receive a biweekly or monthly check based on your total number of billable hours. Although it may seem like a small matter, keep consistent, precise records of each and every billable unit-usually by the quarter hour. Do not rely on your memory at the end of the day to reconstruct your activities, and do not average them out over a week. You will probably be able to fnd an app for your phone that will allow you to keep track of the date, time, and duration of contact as well as a brief note of your activity. At the end of the billing cycle, all you will need to do is perform a few simple calculations to determine your billing to the agency or consulting frm. It is extremely important that you understand how critical it is to your frm that you actually match your hours of service to the contracted hours. If your agency or consulting frm has contracted with a facility for you to spend 20 hours per week onsite, it is inappropriate for you to provide only 16 hours of service. First, the determination was made by the facility and your consulting frm that 20 hours was needed. Te facility has set aside a certain amount of money for your services, and they have mutually agreed that they need 20 hours of consulting or therapy. For you to decide on your own to take a day of without the appropriate approval in advance is inappropriate and constitutes a violation of Code 1.01 Being Truthful. Tis is not in keeping with Core Principle 3, Behave with Integrity.</p><p>Needless to say, accurate and honest time accountability is essential to protect you from any allegation that you have been overbilling or that you have attempted to defraud a client or the government. As an example of what can happen when billing is fraudulent, physicians are being prosecuted at a high rate because they have billed for clients they did not see or for services that were never rendered. It is imperative that billing for behavior analysis services be accurate and honest and that all paperwork is completed correctly and on time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BE ALERT FOR DUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</head><p>One of the most frequent problems we have in behavior analysis service delivery is the development of dual relationships between clients and their therapists or behavior analysts. It is easy to see how this might happen, since behavior analysts usually have excellent social skills and they come across as friendly and eager to please. Tese are likeable traits, and clients may instantly warm up to their therapist and the BCBA supervisor. Before long, a behavior analyst can fnd themselves being treated like family, asked to stay for dinner or to attend an upcoming birthday party or some other special family holiday or celebration. Allowing this to happen means the therapist or behavior analyst has crossed the line from professional to "friend" status, and this is where there is an opportunity for an impairment of the behavior analyst's objectivity. When this happens, the therapist is in a bind, because they need to turn down the ofer in such a way that the client's feelings are not hurt. Tis might then afect the full cooperation needed to make treatment a success. T e solution, of course, is to let clients know in advance that participating in such activities is not allowed due to the rules set by our code of ethics. Chapter 13, the Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures for Behavior Analysts, presents suggestions for handling such situations.</p><p>In behavior analysis, other relationships could be problematic that appear to be unique to our feld. Behavior analysts are not restricted to the role of therapist. Tey are also supervisors, consultants, teachers, and researchers. Behavior analysts may sit on local or statewide human rights or peer-review committees. T ey may own a consulting f rm or be an elected member of a professional association. Serving on a peer-review committee where you are supposed to render an impartial judgment about the quality of a treatment program could present an objectivity problem if a friend or former student prepared the case being reviewed. An owner of a consulting frm has a built-in confict of interest when evaluating a new client. Te potential income from the case may cloud the judgment of the owner from determining that it would be in the client's best interest to refer to another agency with more expertise with a special behavior problem. Of course, the same confict exists at the individual therapist level when he or she must decide to take a client who has been referred. Decisions in all these cases revolve around the question of what is in the client's best interest (Codes 1.03, 2.10, and 3.08). Code 3.01 is explicit on this: "Behavior analysts act in the best interest of clients" rather than what would beneft the therapist, the BCBA, or the agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIND A TRUSTED COLLEAGUE RIGHT AWAY</head><p>It is difcult to make ethical decisions in isolation. Without a sounding board, what appears to be an easy call may in fact be quite a complex dilemma. It is not always easy to determine whether some harm might come from a particular intervention. T e ef ects could be delayed or subtle, and someone else with more experience than you could be a big help in making such a decision. Over time, you will feel more confdent about your behavioral decisions, but in the beginning, to help build your conf dence, we strongly recommend that you fnd a "trusted colleague" as soon as possible. Ideally, this would be another behavior analyst who is easily accessible and who is not your supervisor or your employer. For political and other reasons, the colleague probably should not work for "the competition" in your geographical area. Your trusted colleague is someone that you will trust with questions such as, "Am I really prepared to take this case?" or "My supervisor is telling me do to X, but it seems unethical to me. What should I do?" or, even more importantly, "I think I've made a big mistake, what do I do now?" With luck, you won't encounter any of these dilemmas in your frst 3 months on the job, and you can use this time to try to fnd a person who is knowledgeable and whom you can trust. In your of -hours, your frst 3 months on the job should be spent interacting with other professionals from your workplace and in your general locale. It's a good idea to get to know social workers, nurses, physicians, case managers, psychologists, and client advocates as well as any other behavior analysts in your area. Tis networking will serve other purposes also, such as making referrals. During the process of getting to know your colleagues, you should make the acquaintance of someone who can be more than a casual business associate and become a confdant. You will want to size up this person's approach to ethics and make sure that his or her approach to dealing with complex issues appears to be sound, thoughtful, and deliberate, as opposed to glib or cavalier. A BCBA with 5 or more years of experience who is careful in what he or she does, has a good solid reputation, and who seems friendly and approachable would be a good candidate. You want to fnd your trusted colleague well before anything big "hits the fan," because you will want to have a wellestablished rapport with the person and feel confdent that you can in fact trust him or her with your urgent ethical situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TOUCHING PEOPLE</head><p>Unlike ordinary ofce-based psychotherapy, behavior analysis ofen involves getting up close and personal with your clients.</p><p>Especially for those behavior analysts working with those who have developmental or physical disabilities or behavior disorders, our treatments may involve touching or holding the person. Innocuous procedures such as graduated guidance involve putting your hands on the client to teach them how to feed or dress themselves. Toilet training can involve helping the person remove his or her clothes, and tooth brushing requires the behavior analyst to stand behind the client and help manipulate the brush. Many behavior analysts routinely give "hugs" or brief shoulder massages as reinforcers without thinking of the possible adverse consequences. In all of these cases, even the most benign and well-intentioned action on your part could be misconstrued or misinterpreted as "inappropriate touching." Tis accusation could come from the client, the client's parents, a nearby caregiver, or a visitor who just happened to be on the scene. Other more intrusive behavioral procedures are even more problematic. Time-out almost always involves holding the client while taking them to the time-out room. Manual restraint, or even attempting to apply mechanical restraints, can also present issues of potential misinterpretation or misperception (from "You hurt me" to "You hurt him deliberately" to "Were you groping her? I think you were, I'm going to call the police!").</p><p>Te ethical behavior analyst will always abide by the dictum "Do no harm" and will avoid, at all costs, doing anything to physically or emotionally harm a client in any way. But the cautious, ethical behavior analyst will also make sure that he or she is never the target of a mistaken or malicious accusation of physically inappropriate behavior toward a client. To this end, we make the following recommendations: 1. To avoid a false client allegation of inappropriate touching, always make sure to have another person (ofen called a "witness") present.  Te purpose of these recommendations is not to encourage you to become cold and impersonal in your interactions with clients, but rather to make you aware of how afectionate behavior could be misinterpreted and backfre on you.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEALING WITH NONBEHAVIORAL COLLEAGUES</head><p>A lot of your professional time will be spent with colleagues who are not behavior analysts. Depending on the setting and the history of the agency or organization, this could present you with some serious ethical dilemmas. For example, if as part of a habilitation team you fnd that the consensus of the group is that your client should receive "counseling," you have an ethical obligation to propose a behavioral alternative, Codes 2.01 and 3.12, and to raise questions about whether there are any data on treatment efcacy for counseling (Code 2.01). Code 2.10 recommends collaborating with colleagues from other professions and compromising regarding treatment approaches when it is in the best interest of the client. You may soon discover that the other professionals with whom you work are not very aware of the ethics code for their f eld or pay it little heed. Or worse, you may discover that their code of ethics is not very clear on issues regarding client's rights, the use of empirically based procedures, or the evaluation of treatments using data. New students working in the feld for the frst time are ofen shocked at the manner in which meetings are conducted and decisions are made regarding clients. It is not unusual for one person to dominate the meetings, with a clear motive of getting it over with as soon as possible. Ofen no data are presented, and weak or specious rationales are given for pushing certain treatment approaches. Convenience, a "just go along" attitude, and a disregard for ethics in general are ofen the mode for some meetings that appear to be held more for show than for function. Over time, as you gain experience, you may be asked to chair these meetings and will be able to show how they should be run efciently and ethically in the best interest of your clients.</p><p>Initially, as a new and probably junior member of the treatment team, you will probably want to sit quietly and observe. Try to determine who is in charge and what the custom is for handling decision-making. You may need to consult with your supervisor about how to best handle these situations and to consult the code for key foundation points. Before you accuse anyone in public of engaging in unethical conduct, it would be wise to check again with your supervisor and then meet with the person in question outside of the meetings to discuss your concerns. You could start the conversation with, "Can you help me understand what happened in that meeting?" Tis may also Be a good listener and have done everything possible to have some impact but have been unsuccessful, it may be necessary to conclude your involvement.</p><p>To end on a positive note, it is important to point out that the vast majority of nonbehavioral colleagues are kind and caring, mean well, and will accept you if you accept them. Most have never heard of behavior analysis, so you will have a chance to be an ambassador for the feld and to educate them about current developments and how we are, in the utmost sense, concerned about the ethical, efective, and humane treatment of clients. Be patient and give them a chance to educate you about their f eld. Be a good listener and a positive supportive person, and you will grow immeasurably as a professional yourself. Remain open to other points and view and be honest about your own shortcomings (e.g., you may know very little about medications and their ef ects on behavior). Over time, you will gain insight on how others view behavior, and you will be able to help other professionals understand and accept a behavioral perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</head><p>Sexual harassment is one of those awkward, ugly topics that few people want to discuss unless pressed to do so. Despite years of education, legal rulings, and company fnes, sexual harassment still exists <ref type="bibr">(US EEOC, 2004)</ref>. As a behavior analyst, you might think that you will never be subject to this kind of treatment by others. Although you would never intentionally treat another person in this degrading way, nonetheless, a few behavioral aspects of sexual harassment should be discussed for the new behavior analyst.</p><p>First, we need to address unwanted sexual advances. If you have some special work circumstances, you might be more likely to encounter this problem. BCBAs who work in the client's home may fnd that there are occasions when they are alone with a single parent of the opposite sex. While both males and females can be the victims of sexual harassment, young female therapists seem most vulnerable if there is a divorced or single male in the house. Te problem can start innocently enough, with the person acting very interested in your work, perhaps sitting close, making strong eye contact, or smiling a lot. You might take this as just a very interested person who thinks that you and your work are fascinating. An extra-warm greeting, a hug that lasts just a little too long, or a touch to the arm or shoulder are the frst clues that there may be something else afoot. Behavior analysts are trained to be superb observers of behavior, and this is the skill that you want to bring to bear at this time. Behavior analysts also know how to use DRO, punish behaviors, put them on extinction, or bring them under stimulus control to reduce their rate of occurrence. If you detect the early stages of unusually "familiar" behaviors, it is time to swing into action. You might use DRO by reinforcing the person for sitting a little farther away from you. For any uncomfortable eye-contact responses, look at the f oor or at your paperwork, appear distracted, or abruptly conclude the meeting. Inappropriate touching (e.g., of a less serious nature such as the person patting your hand) can be handled with a "cold hard stare," with no smiling and possibly a no-nonsense "that's really not appropriate, Mr. Robinson." If you catch this in the early stages and punish these tentative behaviors, your problem may be solved. Even in the minor stages, you should discuss this with your supervisor. If it has gone further than this and the person is very inappropriate (e.g., calling you at home, leaving personal email messages, or making any clear attempt to touch you inappropriately), discuss this immediately with your supervisor to determine if it is appropriate to inform authorities. If you believe you are being stalked, contact the authorities immediately; your safety is of utmost importance.</p><p>Te second major concern regarding sexual harassment is the possibility that someone else will accuse you of this behavior. We specifcally train behavior analysts to be ef ective interpersonally, and this includes using head nodding, smiling, warm handshakes, and strong, efective verbal reinforcers. We encourage new consultants to "become a reinforcer" for those around you if you want to be ef ective. Dif erent reinforcing behaviors are appropriate in diferent settings. In business and organizational settings, smiling, handshakes, and positive comments are all appropriate. But you need to be careful that those you are reinforcing don't get the wrong idea and think that you are attracted to them. You might be working with a withdrawn child, for example, and trying to get her to stay on task or complete an assignment. At the frst sign of suc-</p><p>The world would surely cess, you break into a smile be a better place if and give "high f ves." Over everyone adopted the time, this will probably work behavior analyst's ethical to increase the on-task behavprinciples and put them ior. However, you may begin to also increase your rate of hugs. to practical use every day.</p><p>Te next thing you know you get called into the principal's ofce, and she says, "I've just gotten of the phone with Lucy's mother. Lucy has complained that you touched her in her private areas. Is this true?"</p><p>Te best advice to new behavior analysts is to be courteous, polite, and friendly, but in all cases be professional. Do not let your enthusiasm for the progress of your client meeting a goal cause you to get overly emotional with the client. Watch what you do with your hands at all times. As a check on your performance, ask yourself, "What if Channel Six Eyewitness News was here taping this? Would I still engage in this behavior?" If the answer is "No," then you need to modify your own behavior to prevent any misunderstanding or false accusations. said he wanted to talk more about the proposed code for organizations. It was clear that this young man was thinking along the same lines. His name was Adam Ventura, and he had both a strong interest in ethics at the organizational level and the ability to implement change. Adam ofered to develop the concept into an actual working model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COEBO</head><p>COEBO is an acronym from a paper, "Te Code of Ethics for Behavioral Organizations," 1 which began as a seven-item proposal that organizations providing behavior analytic services would sign and agree to uphold within their respective companies. Te original concept was that COEBO would be analogous to a national Better Business Bureau specifcally tailored for ethics for organizations delivering behavior analysis services. An ethical organization would supplement the BACB Code and "wrap around" the behavior analysts that work there to eliminate any subtle forces to act unethically. Trough many discussions with behavior analysts and providers in the community, it became clear that the code needed to be expanded. In approximately one year of vetting by over 50 representative agencies from around the world who strongly support ethics, that conf rmation grew into an all-inclusive code of ethics with ten comprehensive categories <ref type="bibr">(Bailey &amp; Burch, 2016, chap. 20)</ref>. Te COEBO began as an idea to improve organizational behavior and grew into an assembly of behavior analysts, business owners, academics, and consumers of behavior analytic services collaborating to advance their shared goal of improving the ethical conduct of organizations that provide behavior analytic services into one succinct set of guidelines. Over time, our work together on this very vital matter became afectionately known as the "COEBO Movement." Adam worked on the COEBO project for over a year, at which point he realized that to bring the code to scale so that enough organizations recognized it and there was critical mass to really make a movement was going to require of ce staf , of ce space, and salaries. As a demonstration of his level of commitment to this project, Adam worked tirelessly without pay during this entire time. He arranged for someone to feld questions and try to provide support, but there was not a fnancial structure to support COEBO adequately. Tis was an idea that was well ahead of its time, and as a result, COEBO went into hibernation.</p><p>Around the same time, unbeknownst to the frst author and Adam Ventura, the state of California was experiencing numerous challenges measuring the quality of care of ABA organizations. In 2009, a large ABA organization became insolvent and lef hundreds of families without services. As a response to this insolvency, the California Department of Development Disabilities formed a transparency committee aimed to identify and measure quality organizations providing ABA within the state. T is pilot project launched and continued for 5 years. Te project was led by Dr. David Pyles and Sara Gershfeld Litvak. In 2010, Dr. Pyles stepped down from the project, and Litvak continued the state's eforts until 2014. By 2014, the team had evaluated dozens of ABA organizations across the state, and with the onset of the autism mandate, the state decided to defund the project. Subsequently, Litvak requested permission from the state to continue this important work despite the project being defunded. In 2015, Litvak and a group of scientifc advisors, including the f rst author, 2 came together to formalize the Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (BHCOE) as an international accrediting body and began globally discussing and shaping organizational standards and the BHCOE Accreditation Program.</p><p>BHCOE started by drafing standards with a subject matter group that started modestly, with four sections focused on staf qualifcations and training, treatment program and planning, collaboration and coordination of care, and ethical marketing.

T e f ling of a Notice of Alleged Violation can have serious repercussions for the individual, their clients, colleagues, company, and possibly the person fling the Notice.

What follows is a description of the process by which a Notice is fled. We absolutely do not support the reporting of serious allegations against a behavior analyst out of spite or whim or recrimination. Every other means of correcting a wrong or modifying the behavior of a person you feel has violated the code should be explored before taking the step of fling a Notice of Alleged Violation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHY FILE A NOTICE OF ALLEGED VIOLATION WITH THE BACB?</head><p>Sometimes clients, supervisees, or even colleagues make the diffcult decision to take the signifcant step to fle an of cial complaint against a behavior analyst. Tis decision is of en made of frustration with the services or supervision that the client or supervisee is receiving or not receiving. Taking this step is usually preceded by other attempts at bringing an issue to the attention of the therapist or supervisor. A polite question by the client presented at the front door as the therapist is leaving may not leave an impression on the RBT who is rushing of to see the next client. Likewise, a phone call to the supervisor may not seem to be urgent or pressing in the small mountain of calamities they are dealing with that day. Clients or supervisees may fear that if they appear to be angry or too aggressive in pushing for an answer, there could be retribution by the BCBA. Tere is also a factor that involves a person not wanting to ofend someone important in their child's life. Te technician is someone the parents depend on every day to provide assistance, so some will hold back and say nothing . . . for a while. Tey quietly hope that the concern will somehow resolve itself without their having to get involved. Expressed in a mild fashion as a question, initially, a serious concern may be dismissed as, "Tey were having a bad day" or "Tey just needed to let of steam." Unfortunately, when these questions and milder attempts for changes are not responded to in a meaningful fashion, there can be an escalation in anger and resentment on the part of the client or supervisee for not being taken seriously over what is considered an important matter. When a parent says, "I'm not seeing any improvement in Angelica's behavior. Is there anything else we can do?," the behavior analyst might think, "Ms. Lopez just doesn't understand that progress takes time." In fact, what Ms. Lopez really meant to say was, "I want a meeting to change Behavior analysts Angelica's goals." All of this can be need to become better categorized under the label of "mislisteners and also more communication," which is endemic ethical practitioners.</p><p>in our society. Clients don't know the code words that will catch the attention of their behavior analysts, and behavior analysts are predisposed to assume that their clients "just don't understand."</p><p>To prevent clients and supervisees from reaching the point where they feel the need to fle a Notice of Alleged Violation, behavior analysts need to become better listeners and also more ethical practitioners. Tey also need to be prepared to respond sympathetically to what they learn, not to take it personally, and act in a timely fashion. Being proactive in asking the client how they are feeling about It is necessary to have the therapy they are receiving some sort of documentation would be a good frst step to to support an allegation.</p><p>head of the fling of a Notice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHO CAN FILE A NOTICE OF ALLEGED VIOLATION?</head><p>Anyone who has direct knowledge of a violation of the BACB Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts may fle a Notice with the Board. Tis includes clients, parents, and stakeholders, other professionals outside of ABA, and of course, RBTs, BCaBAs, and BCBAs. An RBT can fle a Notice against their supervisor for failing to meet the requirements of Code 4.01-4.12. A supervisor may choose to fle a Notice against an RBT or supervisee or trainee for any number of RBT Ethics Code violations. Some of these violations include engaging in a multiple relationship (1.11), harassing clients or staf (1.09), or operating outside of their scope of competence (1.05).</p><p>A parent or stakeholder may wish to fle a Notice against their RBT therapist for abusing their child or against the BCBA supervisor for revealing confdential information (Codes 2.03, 2.04). In addition to direct knowledge, as opposed to rumor ("I heard from a friend that . . ."), it is necessary to have some sort of documentation to support an allegation. Tis is of en not easy to acquire. A family who observes the therapist chatting on the phone with someone instead of working with their child may not feel comfortable saying anything to the therapist. When the parents bring this to the attention of the supervisor, it might be dismissed as "it must have been a misunderstanding." Te parents may conclude that, since the apparent of-task behavior of the therapist happens of en, there could be insurance fraud involved, but all they have are their observations and assumptions. Te parents don't actually know who the therapist is talking to; it could even be their supervisor, and there is no paper trail. In this case, they should ask for a meeting with the supervisor to clarify everything before fling a Notice of Alleged Violation or calling the insurance company fraud division.</p><p>A supervisee may become frustrated with their supervisor because their meetings are repeatedly canceled or the supervisor is a no-show. How is this documented? It is dif cult to quantify something that doesn't happen. Another example is when, time af er time, the supervisor shows up but is on her iPad the whole time and never looks up to observe the RBT. At the end of the sessions, the supervisor simply says something like, "You're doing a great job Missy, keep up the good work," as she rushes of to a meeting. In this case, the supervisee was led to believe from the ethics course she took that supervision meant she would receive the undivided attention of a BCBA who would observe and take detailed notes during the session and then meet with her af erward for at least 30 minutes to debrief. Missy also thought that following the observation, she would be given notes on what she needed to do to improve her skills; it is easy to see how Missy would feel the urge to f le a Notice against this supervisor if this pattern continued for several weeks or months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INFORMING CLIENTS AND SUPERVISEES ABOUT THEIR RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT</head><p>One of the most frequently overlooked standards in the 2016 code was 2.05(d). Tis standard required that "clients and supervisees must be informed of their rights and about procedures to lodge complaints about professional practices of behavior analysts with the employer, appropriate authorities, and the BACB" (italics added). In the 2022 code, it has become the following:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.04">Service Agreement.</head><p>Before implementing services, behavior analysts ensure that there is a signed service agreement with the client and/or relevant stakeholders outlining. . . . procedures for submitting complaints about a behavior analyst's professional practices to relevant entities (e.g., BACB, service organization, licensure board, funder).</p><p>Note that "must" has become "ensure," which means "makes happen." Tis is nearly as strong as "must." Behavior analysts have an obligation to inform their clients about their right to f le a complaint, and BCBA supervisors have the same requirement to advise their supervisees of this obligation. Te "signed agreement" would be equivalent to the Declaration of Professional Practices and Procedures for Behavior Analysts, described in Chapter 13. For supervisees, a statement to this efect should be in the supervision contract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEVEN STEPS TO FILING A NOTICE OF ALLEGED VIOLATION</head><p>Te BACB describes the process for deciding to fle a Notice of Alleged Violation, which is illustrated in a fowchart on their website (type "Notice of Alleged Violation" in the search box and click on "Reporting to the Ethics Department"), as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">17</ref>.1.</p><p>Once a decision has been made to fle a notice the next step is to fll out the Notice of Alleged Violation form. To fnd this form, go to the search box and type "Reporting Alleged Violations by BCaBAs/BCBAs." Te top part of this form is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_27">17</ref>.2.</p><p>Since the fowchart is greatly reduced and the fonts with the decision-making instructions are so small, we will paraphrase the instructions here.</p><p>Step One: Informal Resolution Consumers or supervisees are advised to attempt to address the concern directly with the behavior analyst if possible. T is should be done in a neutral fashion by starting with simple questions about the incident that the person has observed directly. It is not acceptable to work from rumor or secondhand information. A good way to start is with something like, "Could you help me understand . . .?" where you fll in an objective description of what you have witnessed. Tere is a good chance that the person will have a satisfactory answer for you, and that you will not have to proceed to Step Two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step Two: Conf rm Certif cation Status</head><p>If you still feel afer the conversation described above that there has been a violation, you now must make sure that the person is actually covered by the BACB. In some cases, you may discover that they are not certifed with the board. For example, they might be in a management position, or are they are some other professional such as a PT or OT. In a recent query to the Hotline, an irate mother of a client wanted to fle a "grievance" against her BCBA for abruptly cutting of services and abandoning her child. A rapid back and forth via email ensued, and it turned out that it was the CEO of the small ABA company who discontinued the services, not the BCBA. Te mother was not happy to learn that there was no way to fle a "Notice" against the CEO. To make sure that the person you wish to report comes under the jurisdiction of the board, you can always check with the Certif cant Registry at www.BACB.com .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step Tree: Find a Specifc Code Violation</head><p>To correctly fle a Notice of Alleged Violation, it is necessary to cite the specifc code number that you believe is involved. If you feel that your BCBA made changes to your child's behavior plan without checking with you, for example, you will need to look through the code to fnd the relevant citation. 1 In this case, it would be Code 2.11 Obtaining Informed Consent. In some cases, you may feel that there are several violations, so you will need to look up each one to make sure there is a match between your concern and the specifc code standard.</p><p>Step Four: Producing Documentation Tis step is critical to go forward with a complaint, since it involves producing some sort of documentation to support your allegation. Generally, this means a hard copy of a behavior program, data sheet, email exchange, or perhaps an audio or video tape. Another form of documentation is an afdavit from a second eyewitness to the event in question. Whatever the format, you will need to be prepared to attach a copy of the document to the Notice form, and it needs to match what is alleged.</p><p>Step Five: Time Frame It might have saved you some time and efort if this were Step Two, since if the event in question is over 6 months old, you are not allowed to fle a Notice. 2 But if it happened within that time frame, you may proceed to Step Six.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step Six: Report to Other Agencies First?</head><p>Te nature of some alleged violations is that they really should be reported to some other agency f rst. If the allegation was that the BCBA struck your child and you have it on video, it may be more appropriate to report the person to the police or sherif's department or to Child Protective Services. If the complaint is not of an urgent nature, and you live in a state that has licensing for behavior analysts, the BACB prefers that you report the person to the licensing board before you report them to the BACB. Te purpose of a licensing board is like that of the BACB (i.e., to prevent harm to the general public by setting minimum standards of education and training, and to provide a mechanism for clients, stakeholders, and other behavior analysts to f le complaints). Tese boards are empowered to take disciplinary action against behavior analysts who do not meet the standards of competency or who violate the code of ethics. Te boards have the resources to investigate claims of ethics violations; they have hearings that Once the Notice is received, it is routed to one of two review committees: the Disciplinary Review Committee or the Educational Review Committee. Within each one of these, there are a series of steps that may be taken. 5 Only the most serious, egregious charges warrant disciplinary review, where there may be certain corrective actions and/or sanctions. Most cases are handled by the educational review committee, where a less harsh approach is taken to prevent future ethical violations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE PURPOSE OF AN ETHICS CODE FOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS</head><p>Te primary purpose of a code of ethics for behavior analysts is to establish rules and guidelines for the practice of behavior analysis that will inform and protect the public from harm. A secondary purpose is to protect the professionals in our feld by making clear to the public what we can and cannot do, what is expected, and what the boundaries of our practice are. If professional behavior analysts follow the rules and stay within our ABA scope of practice and their own scope of competence, they should be free from criticism and accusation as long as they have educated their clients and stakeholders of these limitations. In our decade-long engagement with the public and ABA professionals via the Ethics Hotline, it has become clear that we are not doing enough to educate the public about our role and our capabilities. Unfortunately, there are some who will cut corners, succumb to economic or political pressure, or act without thinking of the consequences. Tese behavior analysts are likely to have allegations of unethical conduct f led against them and possibly fnd themselves facing the BACB ethics committee. Following the rules should not be difcult, but the pressures of time, economic benefts, and business contingencies are real and must be recognized for the threat that they pose. As we have said many times publicly, If ethics were easy, "If ethics were easy, everyone everyone would be ethical. would be ethical."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A FINAL NOTE</head><p>It is hoped that this book will help you think about ethics not in a theoretical or purely moral sense, but rather in the practical sense of doing the right thing; doing no harm; being just, truthful, fair, and responsible; afording dignity to your clients; promoting their independence; and in general treating others the way that you would like to be treated. Te world would surely be a better place if everyone adopted the behavior analyst's ethical principles and put them to practical use every day.</p></div>

T is would mean that regardless of their gender expression or immigration status, clients receive their fair share of therapist time and expertise. Te marital or relationship status of a client should not result in lesser quality services or being assigned to therapists with less expertise. Tis burden of fairness and equitable services falls primarily on the clinical director who assigns behavioral staf to incoming clients.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Behavior analysts behave toward others with compassion, dignity,</cell></row><row><cell>and respect by:</cell></row></table><note>(a) Treating others equitably, regardless of factors such as age, disability, ethnicity, gender expression/identity, immigration status, marital/relationship status, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or any other basis proscribed by law. However, BCBAs need to be sensitive to the way in which assignments are made so they can provide counter-control if they feel there is any inequity. Examples of inequity would be if Black or Brown clients were routinely assigned to inexperienced BCBAs, or gay families received fewer hours per week for their child. Meeting the high standard of this ethical principle requires constant vigilance on the part of all behavioral staf . (b) Respecting others' privacy and conf dentiality. Violations of client privacy regarding medical records and personal health information is now covered by federal law via the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).</note></figure>

Te best way to remain current is to read each issue of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA) as soon as it arrives in the mail. In JABA, you will fnd cutting-edge methodology produced by some of the fnest researchers in our feld. New areas of application are constantly emerging and important fndings are being discovered almost on a monthly basis. In addition, attending state and national conferences are a must for remaining in touch with new developments and discovering experts in areas that you may wish to explore to expand your professional competence. (c) Remaining knowledgeable and current about interventions (including pseudoscience) that may exist in their practice areas and pose a risk of harm to clients. Many professionals stopped learning when they fnished their graduate degree. When professionals stop learning and fail to stay current, it leads to stagnation and a loss of creativity and imagination. Tis does not bode well for what lies ahead. Staying on top of the multitude of pseudoscientifc, pop psychology, and mystical treatments that constantly arise can seem overwhelming, but it is necessary if you want to be able to answer questions from consumers who have limited knowledge about treatments.</note></figure>

Behavior analysts do not engage in romantic or sexual relationships with former clients or stakeholders for a minimum of two years from the date the professional relationship ended. Behavior analysts do not engage in romantic or sexual relationships with former supervisees or trainees until the parties can document that the professional relationship has ended (i.e., completion of all professional duties). Behavior analysts do not accept as supervisees or trainees, individuals with whom they have had a past romantic or sexual relationship until at least six months afer the relationship has ended.</note></figure>

Does the company ofer administrative time or some other specifcally allotted time for supervisors to meet/train line therapists (outside of insurance billable hours)? Good answer: Sure. All you have to do is work that out with our clinical director. Just let her know what you need, and she will arrange all the details. Tis is unbillable, so we consider this part of our overhead. We see this cost as necessary to maintain high-quality behavioral services. We've found that this also reduces turnover among our RBTs, since they feel like they are all continuing to learn, and of course, it lets them know how much we appreciate them. Tat counts for a lot. Dubious: Well, really that should be part of supervision. It is part of the 5% that RBTs and trainees get each month. I don't see any reason to add more hours that would be unbillable.Poor answer: My understanding is that RBTs get 40 hours of training on the front end.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_65"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Poor answer: I'm not familiar with the BACB Ethics Code. Can you remind me what those two code items are about? came on board, we could look into reviving the idea if that's something that you might be interested in doing.Poor answer: Hmm, I don't think I've heard of that before . . . 13. How ofen is in-service ethics training conducted by the company?Good answer: We have a monthly ethics in-service where we go over certain code items and have discussions about scenarios that are based on our current cases. Tis session is conducted by our clinical director who trained under some professor who wrote the book on ethics. I can't remember his name. Dubious: We conduct in-service training on an as-needed basis. I don't know that the topic of ethics comes up much, though. Basically, we just have our policy and procedure manual to fall back on if someone messes up. One of our trainees got caught padding his hours sheets, which is unethical, and we had to let him go. Poor answer: Well, my reading of the handbook and the ethics code for RBTs is that they don't need CEUs. For my BCBAs, we just let them pick up ethics CEUs when they go to a conference. 14. What are the procedures for reporting someone in the organization for an ethics violation? Good answer: Tis is a delicate matter that needs to be handled by the book. First, any violation is reported to the chair of the ethics committee, who will look into the matter and see if it was in fact a violation or just a misunderstanding or miscommunication. If it is a violation, we try to determine if it can be handled informally or not. If not, then the person who reported it and who has frsthand knowledge f les a Notice of Alleged Violation with the BACB. We help with the documentation on that. Dubious: As far as I know, we have very few ethical violations at our agency, so we don't really have a process to speak of. Poor answer: Our owner takes care of any ethics problems, and normally he just fres people on the spot. Tis works very well for us. It makes people scared to violate the ethics code. 15. Does your organization fully support the BACB Code ofEthics?Good answer: Yes, absolutely. Dubious: Well, yes for the most part, but as you know there are a lot of gray areas in the code. Tere are dif erent opinions about some of the so-called standards. We have very little turnover, I would say no more than three or four per year at the RBT level and maybe one per year at the BCBA, and most of those were because the person got a job or assignment in another state. We do anonymous satisfaction surveys quarterly to take the pulse of our employees. When something shows up on the survey that could help us improve working conditions, we jump right on it.Dubious: To tell you the truth, turnover among RBTs is fairly high and we had three BCBAs all quit at once last month. I don't know what this is about, but that's why we are interested in having you fll one of those slots.Poor answer: Do you mean people who quit or those that are fred or both? 17. What systems are in place to assess and analyze employee performance? If an employee is said to have "poor performance," how is this handled? Good answer: We have defnitions of each level of performance from 1 to 5, where 5 is excellent. Te BCBAs rate all their RBTs and trainees on a regular basis based on objective measures. A 1 or 2 gets looked at right away, and we employ a BST model for improvement. Sometimes the performance is due to something else, and for that they are sent to HR for counseling.Dubious: HR handles all the annual performance ratings. I'm not sure how that works though.Poor answer: Working in human services is a very subjective business. Our owner has an MBA, and she makes all the promotion and raise decisions. Yes, she's a BCBA-D, she got her training at one of the leading behavior analysis programs in the United States, and she is routinely asked to give presentations on the supervision management system she has developed here.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Poor answer: Now when you say "fully, " exactly what do you mean?

Is a non-compete clause included in your contracts?Good answer: No, we don't believe in non-competes, and besides, we are following the lead of BHCOE, 1 which has come out frmly against non-competes.2 Of course, we are accredited by BHCOE. We are one of only two agencies in this state to be accredited. I'm surprised you didn't ask about that earlier.Dubious: Well, it depends. Our RBTs don't actually sign contracts, so of course they don't have to sign a non-compete. Some of our BCBAs are required to sign non-competes because we're worried that they will leave here and set up their own competing company.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Poor answer: Our board of directors is insistent that every-</cell></row><row><cell>one sign a non-compete.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE 6.03 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE</head><p>A behavior analyst approached the director of a local agency to ask permission to conduct a research study in the agency. Tis particular agency served children with autism and other severe intellectual and developmental disabilities. Te director approved the project to be done there, since the focus of the research could have direct beneft to the clients served. Te researcher had a team of research assistants who recruited f ve children in the school to serve as participants (the agency's HRC approved the project). Each day, all fve of the participants were scheduled to work with a research assistant, on research activities, for 45 minutes. Te research continued for 3 months. Two of the fve children had their annual meetings to review their academic progress for the year. During the meeting, the director of the agency reviewed the research activity being conducted within the agency. A parent of one of the children involved in the study was quite interested in the work and asked how much time his daughter participated in the research activities. Te director mentioned that each child participated 45 minutes per day. Te parent was surprised, and somewhat incredulous, that his child spent almost four hours each week not working on the academic and clinical goals agreed upon by last year's IEP. Is there a problem here? Is there anything to do? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION, AGREEMENT, SIGNATURES, DATE AND DISTRIBUTE</head><p>At the end of the declaration information session, which could take 30 minutes or so, the client and the behavior analyst should sign the declaration. A witness probably one of the stakeholders should also be present to ensure that signatures are authentic. Date the document, provide a copy to the family, and keep one for your f les.</p><p>Dubious: It depends on whichever BCBA has an opening. Our staf can handle most any kind of case.</p><p>Poor answer : Tere are no special cases; it's all behavior, right? 4. Would the company support the BCBA if they stated they felt unable to take on more cases or a specif c case? Good answer: Absolutely. Our clinical director is in very close touch with our BCBAs; she meets with them once a week to discuss their cases, do some troubleshooting, and decide if we need to change any assignments.</p><p>Dubious: I think the BCBA shouldn't really need support. BCBAs are here to support the organization and their RBT staf .</p><p>Poor answer: Well, we would have to talk about that. We want team players who will do what is necessary to make the company a success.</p><p>In-Service and Support Good answer: Tat can be arranged, but it will take a little doing since we will have to get some forms signed by parents. Also, these will be here at the clinic. I don't think I could get you into one of the in-home sessions. Good answer: Same answer here. Our CEO has two adult children who are BCBAs and who wanted to work here with their dad. He was frm and said, "No, that's not a good idea. It will do nothing but cause morale problems with my staf ."</p><p>on short notice and under the pressure of a short deadline. She avoided taking intelligence-testing classes in graduate school and pointed this out to her supervisor, along with a question about why this requirement was not mentioned in the job interview.</p><p>Ten she pointed out how the BACB Code discourages behavior analysts from working outside of their area of expertise. In some cases, this "attitude" can brand a person "not a team player," but really it is an ethical issue. Even if she did do the testing, it would not be valid, and what if someone made a decision based on the test scores ? T is would surely be unethical. So, to avoid situations like this one, make sure that you ask plenty of questions early on. In the job interview and once you've started work, ask about what is expected, and establish the ethical boundaries necessary to protect yourself from engaging in unethical behavior.</p><p>Most people just starting out on their first job are excited to be doing what they've dreamed about for years, which is practicing behavior analysis as a professional and making a difference in people's lives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DON'T GET IN OVER YOUR HEAD</head><p>Most people just starting out on their frst job are excited to be doing what they've dreamed about for years, which is practicing behavior analysis as a professional and making a dif erence in people's lives. Early on, you are likely to be so grateful to have a job that you will do nearly anything to please your supervisor and upper-level management. Your enthusiasm could actually cause some harm. If it turns out that you accept more clients than you can manage or take on cases without recognizing they are out of your scope of competence, there clearly could be damage in some form to a client. Your most important goal is to do a f rst-class</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Code of Ethics for Professional Organizations</head><p>A BRIEF HISTORY Te foundation for the frst organization to create a code of ethics for behavioral organizations was established in 2005. It was then that the frst author began receiving ethics questions from former students, participants in ethics workshops, and from individuals using the ABA International Hotline. In case afer case, it appeared that professional behavior analysts who were sincerely attempting to adhere to the Guidelines for Responsible Conduct (now the 2022 BACB Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts) were being hindered by their own companies. Obstacles to ethical conduct were thrown at these behavior analysts from every direction.</p><p>Tere were too many cases to manage, cost-cutting procedures such as pre-packaged "cut-and-paste" behavior programs, restrictions on the use of functional analysis prior to treatment, and even pressure to bill for more hours than actually worked. It seemed impossible for these honest, hardworking professionals to meet both their employment requirements and their ethics code obligations. And then a solution appeared in the form of a new idea.</p><p>Why not create a code of ethics for behavioral organizations, one that would require administrators, CEOs, and boards of directors to commit in writing to support the BACB Guidelines? T e f rst author met with a member of the audience who came up af er a presentation on this proposal at the FABA annual meeting and DOI: 10.4324/9781003198550-20 quickly became a fast-growing movement, and it became evident that quality organizations wanted to be recognized for their good work, and staf and patients needed a way to dif erentiate between quality organizations and "bad actors." When BHCOE learned of the work that Bailey and Ventura had done, Sara Litvak (now CEO of BHCOE) approached the f rst author and asked for an introduction to Ventura and wanted to know if she could integrate the work that they had done into her new accreditation organization. In addition to the desire to add an ethics component to her already extensive organizational accreditation process, the group felt strongly that the feld needed to have a united voice, so the collaboration seemed like a natural f t to all parties. COEBO had a new home and a somewhat dif erent format; it became a more robust evaluation tool that included the original checklist, attestations, survey questions to verify items, now refecting a rigorous multimodal evaluation.</p><p>Today, BHCOE is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). A BHCOE commission of members that represent a variety of stakeholders work together to develop and evaluate BHCOE's standards via a transparent, consensusbased process that allows for participation and comment by all stakeholders. BHCOE commission members include representation from patients or their parents/guardians, ABA providers of varying sizes, private and public insurance, trade associations, local state ABA chapters, and academics with specializations in ABA. Tis consensus-driven approach is considered best practice for standard development and has contributed to the ethics checklist found below.</p><p>In refecting on the role that it has played in the ABA community, the organization grew from evaluating just eight organizations for accreditation in 2015 to over 600 organizations to date. T e total number of ABA organizations evaluated during BHCOE's f rst 5 years represents more than 25,000 professionals providing services to over 42,000 people with autism and related developmental disabilities. BHCOE continues to help professionals like those</p><p>reading today by setting quality standards for organizations that are committed to transparency and commitment to ethics and other best practices. BHCOE also ofers those who may be concerned about the quality of an organization to fle a compliance concern that the organization will investigate and work to coach the organization into compliance, or in some cases to suspend or revoke accreditation. Te BHCOE accreditation badge can help clinicians assess a prospective or current employer's commitment to their professional development and help them deliver the best care possible.
